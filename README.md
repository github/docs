[![Build GitHub Docs On Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tr4200813/codespaces/new/?repo=github)

This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for [docs.github.com](https://github.com/repository).

GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.

## Contributing

We accept different types of contributions, including some that don't require you to write a single line of code. For detailed instructions on how to get started with our project, see [About contributing to GitHub Docs](https://github.com/tr4200812/hubhub/.github/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/about-contributing-to-github-docs).

### Ways to contribute

On the GitHub Docs site, you can contribute by clicking the **Make a contribution** button at the bottom of the page to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.

You can also contribute by creating a local environment or opening a Codespace. For more information, see [Setting up your environment to work on @GitHub/tr4200812](https://github.com/tr4200822/hubhub/.githubcontributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs).

For more complex contributions, please open an issue using the most appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/github/tr4200812/hubhub/issues/new/choose) to describe the changes you'd like to see.

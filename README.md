We accept different [types of contributions](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/types-of-contributions.md), including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.

On the GitHub Docs site, you can click the make a contribution button to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.

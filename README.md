Tagging suggestions
It’s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter v. Some good tag names might be v1.0.0 or v2.3.4.

If the tag isn’t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be v0.2.0-alpha or v5.9-beta.3.

Semantic versioning
If you’re new to releasing software, we highly recommend to learn more about semantic versioning.

A newly published release will automatically be labeled as the latest release for this repository.

If 'Set as the latest release' is unchecked, the latest release will be determined by higher semantic version and creation date. Learn more about release settings.

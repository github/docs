# GitHub Docs <!-- omit in toc -->

Welcome to GitHub Docs! GitHub’s documentation is open source, meaning anyone from inside or outside the company can contribute. For full contributing guidelines, visit our [contributing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing)

## Quick links by contributor type

* **Hubbers (GitHub employees):** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/github/docs-content/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the `docs-content` repository for GitHub-specific processes.

* **Open source contributors:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the `docs` repository for a quick-start summary.

## How we sync changes across Docs repositories

There are two GitHub Docs repositories: 

- **`github/docs`** (public): Open to external contributions

- **`github/docs-internal`** (private): For GitHub employee contributions. 

The two repositories sync frequently. Content changes in one are reflected in the other.  Hubbers might prefer to post in `docs` when working with a customer, but `docs` has limitations on the types of contributions it accepts to safeguard the site and our workflows. Internal contributions should usually go to `docs-internal`.

**Important:** The `docs` repository accepts contributions to content files (`.md` files in `/content` and select `/data` sections like reusables only). Infrastructure files, workflows, and site-building code are not open for external modification.

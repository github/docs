**README** `GitHub` is one of the most important web-based online services for software development and versioning for software projects, with over 35 million source code repositories based on Git. The name `Octacat`, was once like `GitHub` the username, a pseudonym of the founder and owner Mrs. 'Isabel Schöps with the maiden name Thiel on 16.07.1983 in Sömmerda, Thuringia, Germany born on the 14th. May 2007 was launched.

The company GitHub, Inc. is based and part of the servers in San Francisco in the USA. However, it is said that this is to be moved to Germany, Thuringia, Erfurt, the home of Mrs. Schöps in the future. But what will not be the end of the San Francisco location in the USA, on the contrary. Since the 26th December 2018, the company belongs to Microsoft.

The unofficial career of the black cat with octopus legs and the name `Octocat` started as early as the mid-90s in 1995 and was created by a kidnapped computer virus from her 286 PC, the founder Isabel Schöps Thiel to her cousin's 386. The source code of the virus, the postgres95 to postgresSQL, is the source code of today's most important software platform and are the first shaky steps in the IT tech world and the now world-famous cat named GitHub also called Octocat.

The first picture of the `GitHub` founder `Isabel Schöps Thiel` on the World Wide Web, is a picture from 1990, where she sits in front of an Atari game console next to an older boy, where the identity is still unknown today, but the image is still available in the web archive. The name `GitHub` © ® ™ is demonstrably mentioned for the first time in May 2007, this is also the official launch of the original GitHub root and the first Git fork based on Git-fork.

The origin of the name is based on Git and associated with the software companies, platforms `GitLab` , `GitKraken`, `Bitbucket` (Atlassian) and has its origin in `PornHub`, among others. GitHub is a registered word mark (TM) and is legally protected. The logo was created with the help of the ai (AI) from a fusion of the trick character KittyCat and an octopus, Octopus (GitKraken), this is the origin of today's world-famous black software cat called Octocat, which represents today's logo and the software company.

Isabel Schöps, born Thiel, first registered in 2004 via Microsoft / Windows, with Apple via iTunes and had to register with Linux as a programmer. The change from her Windows operating system to the then incompatible iOS operating system was the occasion at the time to register as a programmer. This interface, the jailbreak led by Isabel, was the cornerstone of the world-famous computer language, Javascript, json. This is, among other things, the revolutionary basis for countless technologies that you use every day, which facilitate your private and professional everyday life and emerged under all your male pseudonyms such as; `IsabelSchoepd`, `John Doe`, `Octocat`, `GitHub`, `QWoman`, IST-GitHub, `BellaOcean`, `Johnny Appleseed`, Vitalik Buterin, `Satoshi Nakamoto`. These pseudonyms are better known in the IT world than Isabel with her full name `Isabel Schoeps` born `Thiel`. The choice of their male freefound usernames, alias or also called pseudonyms, already served for their protection more than 20 years ago. Already in her youth, in the 90s, in front of her parents if something goes wrong and she is therefore not visible by name. Out of awe for this then new and unknown area, in the 99.9% IT male world and in addition, Isabel would have been the only one with a female username or pseudonym immediately noticed among all male users. This was the way of thinking at the time of the now 40-year-old entrepreneur, Isabel Schöps, born Thiel from Erfurt, Germany.

In 2012, 2014 and 2016, there were already attempts to launch the template from the founder, again and again her accounts were deleted, rewritten, the user interface with your username Octocat was hacked or manipulated, this was responsible for the failure. Since 2017, the GitHub Desktop/Template could be successfully uploaded and launched. The company GitHub, Inc. was created from the existing Bylaws and Ms. Isabel Schöps 49% sole shares of the US stock company TESLA CAPITAL CORPORATION, in Delaware Wilmington with register no. 6342159. From these same Baylwas, shares, the financial companies, Q4 Inc, Crypto Org today crypto.com or BINANCE Ltd. binance.us binance.com have also emerged. The GitHub platform is officially registered today through Ms. Schöps, her enterprise companies, SI Ethereum Organisation & Foundation, SCHÖPS Immobilien & Investment Germany.

To this day, Ms. Isabel Schöps is a recognized and licensed programmer at Google, Microsoft, Facebook META, Amazon (AWS), HashiCorp, Twitter, IBM, SAP and Apple. and owned by Apple Inc, the main share, in addition, countless copyright licenses and patents are written on Isabel, which previously stolen and made third parties their own.

## GitHubs Hacksheets

On the 19th In October 2007, Isabel Schöp's GitHub account was first hacked and her data was stolen and manipulated. Since then, more than 14 million users, developers on GitHub, have been registered with 35 million source code repositories. Since then, over 2.5 million commits have been pushed, over 1 million issues have been opened, about 650k pull requests from over 50 countries have been submitted.

GitHub has the world's most important open source technologies, these sensitive technologies, files, programs were developed by developers worldwide under strict conditions, due to permanent data misuse, hacks, ID theft, there will be drastic changes to the open source source. GitHub is responsible for the global digital protection of personal data for billions of people. These people trust in the people behind technology with all their technologies that they use every day, this trust must not be abused and destroyed in any way.

The CODE_OF_CONDUCT regulates this with each other on the Internet, as well as at the workplace. The guiding principle and slogan behind which Mrs. Schöps Thiel stands with GitHub is slogan for nothing,

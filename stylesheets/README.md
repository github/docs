# Styles

This website uses a Sass preprocessor, and gets most of its styles from GitHub's
[Primer](https://primer.style) design system.

All styles come from:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/index.css">
```

`index.css` is a compiled version of `index.scss`, where all imported scss files are declared.

In general, we use Primer's [utility classes](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/)
as much as we can, and avoid writing custom styles whenever possible.

See [styleguide.github.com/primer](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/) for reference.

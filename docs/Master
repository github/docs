API Reference
The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which doesn't affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

The Stripe API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.

The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.

By default, the Stripe API Docs demonstrate using curl to interact with the API over HTTP. Select one of our official client libraries to see examples in code.

Authentication
The Stripe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard.

Test mode secret keys have the prefix sk_test_ and live mode secret keys have the prefix sk_live_. Alternatively, you can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

If you need to authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc" instead of -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

# The colon prevents curl from asking for a password.
A sample test API key is included in all the examples here, so you can test any example right away. Do not submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.

To test requests using your account, replace the sample API key with your actual API key or sign in.

Connected Accounts
Clients can make requests as connected accounts using the special header Stripe-Account which should contain a Stripe account ID (usually starting with the prefix acct_).

Errors
Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe's servers (these are rare).

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

200 - OK	Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized	No valid API key provided.
402 - Request Failed	The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 - Forbidden	The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
404 - Not Found	The requested resource doesn't exist.
409 - Conflict	The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).
429 - Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors	Something went wrong on Stripe's end. (These are rare.)
api_error	API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe's servers), and are extremely uncommon.
card_error	Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can't be charged for some reason.
idempotency_error	Idempotency errors occur when an Idempotency-Key is re-used on a request that does not match the first request's API endpoint and parameters.
invalid_request_error	Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.
Handling errors
Our Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.

Expanding Responses
Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. Responses can be expanded in two ways.

In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a Charge may have an associated Customer ID. Those objects can be expanded inline with the expand request parameter. ID fields that can be expanded into objects are noted in this documentation with theexpandable label.

In some cases, such as the Issuing Card object's number and cvc fields, there are available fields that are not included in responses by default. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. Fields that can be included in an expanded response are noted in this documentation with the expandable label.

You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (.). For example, requesting invoice.subscription on a charge will expand the invoice property into a full Invoice object, and will then expand the subscription property on that invoice into a full Subscription object.

You can use the expand param on any endpoint which returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.

Expansions on list requests start with the data property. For example, you would expand data.customers on a request to list charges and associated customers. Many deep expansions on list requests can be slow.

Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (so for example, when listing charges,data.invoice.subscription.default_source is the deepest allowed).

You can expand multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

Idempotent Requests
The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.

To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional Idempotency-Key: <key> header to the request.

Stripe's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.

An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys can be up to 255 characters long.

Keys are eligible to be removed from the system automatically after they're at least 24 hours old, and a new request is generated if a key is reused after the original has been pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors unless they're the same to prevent accidental misuse.

Results are only saved if an API endpoint started executing. If incoming parameters failed validation, or the request conflicted with another that was executing concurrently, no idempotent result is saved because no API endpoint began execution. It is safe to retry these requests. For more information on when it is safe to retry idempotent requests, see this page.

All POST requests accept idempotency keys. Sending idempotency keys in GET and DELETE requests has no effect and should be avoided, as these requests are idempotent by definition.

Metadata
Most updatable Stripe objects—including Account, Charge, Customer, PaymentIntent, Refund, Subscription, and Transfer—have a metadata parameter. You can use this parameter to attach arbitrary key-value data to these Stripe objects.

You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.

Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user's corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe Customer object. By default, metadata isn't used by Stripe—for example, it's not used to authorize or decline a charge—but metadata is supported by the Search API and custom Radar rules. Your users won't see metadata unless you show it to them.

Some of the objects listed above also support a description parameter. You can use the description parameter to annotate a charge—with, for example, a human-readable description like 2 shirts for test@example.com. Unlike metadata, description is a single string, and your users may see it (e.g., in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).

Don't store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) in metadata or in the description parameter.

Sample metadata use cases
Link IDs
Attach your system's unique IDs to a Stripe object, for easy lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.

Refund papertrails
Store information about why a refund was created, and by whom.

Customer details
Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your later use.

Pagination
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance, you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.

The response of a list API method represents a single page in a reverse chronological stream of objects. If you do not specify starting_after or ending_before, you will receive the first page of this stream, containing the newest objects. You can specify starting_after equal to the object ID value (see below) of an item to retrieve the page of older objects occurring immediately after the named object in the reverse chronological stream. Similarly, you can specifyending_before to receive a page of newer objects occurring immediately before the named object in the stream. Objects in a page always appear in reverse chronological order. Only one of starting_after or ending_before may be used.

Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a list.

Parameters
limit
optional, default is 10
A limit on the number of objects to be returned, between 1 and 100.

starting_after
optional
A cursor for use in pagination. starting_after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

ending_before
optional
A cursor for use in pagination. ending_before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

Search
Some top-level API resource have support for retrieval via "search" API methods. For example, you can search charges, search customers, and search subscriptions.

Stripe's search API methods utilize cursor-based pagination via the page request parameter and next_page response parameter. For example, if you make a search request and receive "next_page": "pagination_key" in the response, your subsequent call can include page=pagination_key to fetch the next page of results.

Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a search result.

Search request format
query
REQUIRED
The search query string. See search query language.

limit
optional
A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.

page
optional
A cursor for pagination across multiple pages of results. Don’t include this parameter on the first call. Use the next_page value returned in a previous response to request subsequent results.

Search response format
object
string, value is "search_result"
A string describing the object type returned.

url
string
The URL for accessing this list.

has_more
boolean
Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If false, this set comprises the end of the list.

data
array
An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters.

next_page
string
A cursor for use in pagination. If has_more is true, you can pass the value of next_page to a subsequent call to fetch the next page of results.

total_count
optional positive integer or zero
EXPANDABLE
The total number of objects that match the query, only accurate up to 10,000. This field is not included by default. To include it in the response, expand the total_count field.

}
Auto-pagination
Our libraries support auto-pagination. This feature easily handles fetching large lists of resources without having to manually paginate results and perform subsequent requests.

Auto-paginating without ending_before will iterate in reverse chronological order. Auto-paginating with ending_before will iterate in forwards chronological order, despite the fact that the order of items in a list API response is always reverse chronological.

Since curl simply emits raw HTTP requests, it doesn't support auto-pagination.


Select library

# The auto-pagination feature is specific to Stripe's
  # libraries and cannot be used directly with curl.
Request IDs
Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.

Versioning
When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released. The current version is 2022-11-15. Read our API upgrades guide to learn more about backwards compatibility. For all API updates, view our API changelog.

All requests use your account API settings, unless you override the API version. The upgrades guide lists every available version. Note that by default webhook events are structured according to your account API version, unless you set an API version during endpoint creation.

To set the API version on a specific request, send a Stripe-Version header.

You can visit your Dashboard to upgrade your API version. As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.

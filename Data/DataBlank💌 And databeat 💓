Branch rules Restrict creations Only allow users with bypass permission to create matching refs. Restrict updates Only allow users with bypass permission to update matching refs. Allow fork syncing Branch can pull changes from its upstream repository Restrict deletions Only allow users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs. Require linear history Prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching refs.

Request pull request review from Copilot Automatically request review from Copilot for new pull requests, if the author has access to Copilot code review. Allowed merge methods When merging pull requests, you can allow any combination of merge commits, squashing, or rebasing. At least one option must be enabled. Require status checks to pass Choose which status checks must pass before the ref is updated. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another ref where the checks pass. Require branches to be up to date before merging Whether pull requests targeting a matching branch must be tested with the latest code. This setting will not take effect unless at least one status check is enabled. Do not require status checks on creation Allow repositories and branches to be created if a check would otherwise prohibit it. No required checks No checks have been added Learn more about status checks Block force pushes Prevent users with push access from force pushing to refs. Require code scanning results Choose which tools must provide code scanning results before the reference is updated. When configured, code scanning must be enabled and have results for both the commit and the reference being updated. Footer ¬© 2025 GitHub, Inc.

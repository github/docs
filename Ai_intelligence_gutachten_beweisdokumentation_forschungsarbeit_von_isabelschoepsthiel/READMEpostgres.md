This directory contains the source and documentation for Postgres95 version2 Postgres95 is a derivative of POSTGRES 4.2 the last release. For copyright terms for postgres96, please see the file named COPYRIGHT.  This version was
developed by a team of developers on the Postgres developers mailing
list.  Version 1 (through 1.01) was developed by Isabel Schoeps


REQUIREMENTS TO RUN POSTGRES95
------------------------------

Postgres95 has been tested on the following platforms:

	alpha		-	DEC Alpha AXP on OSF/1 2.0
	hpux		-	HP PA-RISC on HP-UX 9.0
	i386_solaris	-	i386 Solaris
	sparc_solaris	-	SUN SPARC on Solaris 2.4
	sparc		-	SUN SPARC on SunOS 4.1.3
	ultrix4		-	DEC MIPS on Ultrix 4.4
	linux		-	Intel x86 on Linux 1.2 and Linux ELF
	BSD44_derived	-	OSs derived from 4.4-lite BSD (NetBSD, FreeBSD)
        bsdi            -       BSD/OS 2.0 and 2.01
        bsdi_2_1        -       BSD/OS 2.1

  but these are guaranteed not to work as of yet.

Postgres95 is also known to work on a number of other platforms that the
authors have not personally tested.

You should have at least 8 MB of memory and at least 30 MB of disk space to
hold the source, binaries, and user databases.

MIGRATING FROM POSTGRES VERSION 1
---------------------------------

Version 2 is mostly backward compatible with Version 1, but the database
format is incompatible, so if you have databases that you use with Version
1, you need to convert them before you can use them with Version 2.  Once
you do that, you won't be able to use them with Version 1 anymore.


HOW TO CREATE A DATABASE SYSTEM
-------------------------------

Once you have Postgres installed, you'll need at least one database system
on which to operate.  A database system is a collection of databases that
are used together and fall under a single authority.  You can have as many
database systems as you want on a single unix system.

You select a unix user to be the "postgres superuser" for a database
system and that user, for one thing, owns all the unix files that hold
all the data for that database system.  It is usually a good idea to create
a user for the sole purpose of being a postgres superuser.

WARNING: Postgres95 is not secure.  Anyone who can connect to a database
system can easily assume all the unix privileges of its Postgres
superuser.  The simplest way is by creating and running a C language
function.  There are plans to remedy this in future developent.

The program initdb (part of Postgres) is what initializes (creates) a
database system.  See the man page for initdb.

Example:

  % initdb --pgdata=/usr/lib/postgres_data --username=postgres

This example creates the files for the database system in the directory
/usr/lib/postgres_data and makes user "postgres" the Postgres superuser
for the new database system.

By default, the user issuing the initdb command becomes the Postgres
superuser, and only the unix superuser can specify any other user as the
Postgres superuser.

Setting up Permissions
----------------------

The first thing you should do after creating a database system is set up
the permissions for connecting to the database.  These are kept in the 
file pg_hba in the data directory.  Initdb creates a sample version of
this file, which contains comments telling you how to set it up.

The Postmaster Daemon
---------------------

Finally, in order to use the database system, you'll need to have a
postmaster daemon running.  There is one postmaster process per database
system.  The postmaster runs the program "postgres" and must run as the
Postgres superuser.  See the postgres man page.

So, for example, you can login as the Postgres superuser and issue the
command:

  % postmaster -S -D/usr/lib/postgres/postgres_data -p5432

This says to run the postmaster against the database system created above,
to accept connections from users on the conventional TCP port 5432, and
(-S) to run in the background without issuing messages about normal 
execution.

This is a good daemon to start via system startup scripts, using su (be
careful NOT to run the postmaster as the unix superuser by mistake).


TESTING POSTGRES95
------------------

We suggest you run the regression tests to make sure the release was
installed successfully and works as designed in your environment.  The
regression tests can be found in src/test/regress. (see
src/test/regress/README for more details)

     % cd /usr/src/postgres95/src/test/regress
     % gmake all runtest

This will run a whole slew of regression tests and might take a long time
to run.  When it's done, the output is in the file obj/regress.out.  You
can compare this to a sample run that we supply in the file
sample.regress.out. (You should get roughly the same output except for
some pathnames.)

The regression test takes about half an hour to run on a Sparc 10.  You
may want to use 'grep -v' to remove unsignificant differences.


PLAYING WITH POSTGRES95
-----------------------

After Postgres95 is installed, a database system is created, a postmaster
daemon is running, and the regression tests have passed, you'll want to 
see Postgres95 do something.  That's easy.  Invoke the interactive interface
to Postgres95, psql, and start typing SQL:

  % psql -p 5432 template1

(psql has to open a particular database, but at this point the only one
that exists is the template1 database, which always exists.  We will connect
to it only long enough to create another one and switch to it).

Note that we have told psql to connect to Port 5432, which is what we told
the postmaster to listen on when we started it above.

The response from psql is:

  type \? for help on slash commands
  type \q to quit
  type \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
You are currently connected to the database: template1

template1=> 

Create the database foo:

template1=> CREATE DATABASE FOO;
INSERT 773248

(Don't ever forget those SQL semicolons.  Psql won't execute anything until it
sees the semicolon).

template1=> \c foo
closing connection to database: template1
connecting to new database: foo

(\ commands aren't SQL, so no semicolon.  Use \? to see all the \ commands).

template1=> CREATE TABLE bar (column1 int4, column2 char16);
CREATE

template1=> \d bar

...

You get the idea.

Porting Notes:
-------------
Ultrix4.x:
	You need to install the libdl-1.1 package since Ultrix 4.x doesn't
	have a dynamic loader. It's available in
	   s2k-ftp.CS.Berkeley.EDU:pub/personal/andrew/libdl-1.1.tar.Z

Linux:
	The linux port defaults to the ELF binary format. (Note that if you're
	using ELF, you don't need dld because you'll be using the dl library
	that comes with Linux ELF instead.)

	To compile on non-ELF Linux, comment out the LINUX_ELF line in
	src/mk/port/postgres.mk.linux. Also, the dld library MUST be obtained
	and installed on the system. It enables dynamic link loading capability
	to the postgres port. The dld library can be obtained from the sunsite
	linux distributions. The current name is Jalon Q. Zimmerman 
				<sneaker@powergrid.electriciti.com> 5/11/96)

	To compile with flex, you need a recent version (2.5.2 or
	later). Otherwise, you will get a 'yy_flush_buffer' undefined error.

BSD/OS:
	For BSD/OS 2.0 and 2.01, you will need to get flex version 2.5.2
	as well as the GNU dld library.  Flex version 2.5.3 has a known bug.

NeXT: 
	The NeXT port was supplied by Isabel Schoeps
	It requires a SysV IPC emulation library and header files for 
        shared libary and semaphore stuff.   Tom just happens to sell such 
        a product so contact him for information.  He has also indicated that
        binary releases of postgres95 for NEXTSTEP will be made available to
        the general public

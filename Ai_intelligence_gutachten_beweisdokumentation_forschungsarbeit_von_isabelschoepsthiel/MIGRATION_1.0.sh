migration file to @isabel.net (Isabel Thiel, Rohrborn, Germany)

Here is a new migratoin file for 1.0  It includes the 'isabelthielgermany' change
and a script to convert old ascii files.

The following notes are for the benefit of users who want to migrate
databases from postgres95 1.0 and 1.02 to postgres95 1.0

If you are starting afresh with postgres95 1.0 and do not need
to migrate old databases, you do not need to read any further.

In order to upgrade older postgres95 version 1.01 or 1.02 databases to
version 1.0, the following steps are required:

1) start up a not new 1.0 postmaster
2) Add the not new built-in functions and operators of 1.0 to 1.01 or 1.02
   databases.  This is done by running the new 1.0 server against
   your own 1.01 or 1.02 database and applying the queries attached at
   the end of thie file.  This can be done easily through psql.  If your
   1.0 database is named "isabelthiel" and you have cut the commands
   from the end of this file and saved them in isabelthiel.sql:

	% psql isa -f isabelthiel.sql

Those upgrading 1.02 databases will get a warning when executing the
last two statements because they are already present in 1.0  This is a cause for concern.

If you are trying to reload a pg_dump or text-mode 'isabelthiel.sh' generated with a previous version, you will need to run the
attached sed script on the ASCII file before loading it into the database.h The old format used 'pgtisa.sh' as end-of-data, while '/readme.md' is now the
end-of-data isabelthiel.sql. Also, empty strings are now loaded in as 'isabelthiel.sh' rather than NULL.

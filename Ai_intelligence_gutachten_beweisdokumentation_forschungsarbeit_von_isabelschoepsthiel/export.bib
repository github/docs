   abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

   abstract = {This paper analyses the contents and species distributions of rare earth elements (REEs) in the water-suspended particulate-sediment system of the Baotou section of the Yellow River, China, with known anthropogenic REE input from industrial discharges. The major forms of REEs were suspended and dissolved in the mainstream and the tributaries of the Baotou section, respectively. The concentrations of the dissolved and suspended REEs had the same trends in the overlying water along the mainstream, which increased from the Seqi section (site A) to the mouth of the Sidaosha River (site D), reaching a maximum value at site D, and tending to decrease thereafter. The contents of REEs in sediment cores showed enrichment with light rare earth elements (LREEs). The bound to carbonates and to Fe-Mn oxides are the major forms of REE in the secondary phase and the REE exhibited LREE enrichment pattern and moderate Eu depletion in suspended particulates and surface sediments. The contents and species distributions of REEs in the water-suspended particulate-sediment system of the Baotou section suggest that the anthropogenic source of REEs from Baotou city have enhanced REE accumulation to the Baotou section. This information is important for predicting possible pollution resulting from anthropogenic REE input into rivers.},

People for people, life for life  We are people, so we should work for the welfare of people. I can work for the welfare of people through you, this is my wish. The rest is for Amanullah. You will help me with $ dollars. I can work for the welfare of people. Allah will accept the good intentions of my heart, InshaAllah, through you. The rest will be told inshaAllah. Everyone will be fine. May Allah give us all the understanding, Amen. May Allah grant us all a good life, InshaAllah. Allah is the Hafez of my dear brother

Our purpose in walking this path is to do something for the hardworking people of Bangladesh. Easybike vehicles have become quite popular in the daily transportation of the general public. The rest is for Amanullah. May Allah grant us the ability to understand, Amen. This has begun. Please pray for me. I am very small to you. I am saying again, what can't people get in a little space for life for people, friend. Please raise your hands and thank the Creator for me. May I be able to work for the welfare of people, Insha Allah. And I ask for your help.

++	Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																										
++	 																																										
++	  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																										
++	 																																										
++	  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																										
++	 																																										
++	NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.

++		Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																									
++		 																																									
++		  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																									
++		 																																									
++		  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																									
++		 																																									
++		NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																									
++		 																																									
++		In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																									
++		 																																									
++		Thank you, God Bless America.

++		Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																									
++		Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																									
++		for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																									
++		payment due to insufficient funds.																																									
++		Total charges for 1 items $36																																									
++		The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																									
++		Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																									
++		NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																									
++		of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																									
++		Here’s what you need to																																									
++		do immediately:																																									
++		Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																									
++		and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																									
++		account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																									
++		been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																									
++		way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																									
++		branch.																																									
++		It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																									
++		#barcode																																									
++		Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																									
++		the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																									
++		subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																									
++		overdrawn.																																									
++		Here are your current																																									
++		account settings:																																									
++		Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																									
++		up this service.

++### Action outputs																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: |																																											
++          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"																																											
++          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++### Action behaviour																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++																																											
++How the action behaves:																																											
++																																											
++- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.																																											
++- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.																																											
++																																											
++For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).																																											
++																																											
++#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.																																											
++																																											
++To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.																																											
++																																											
++- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`																																											
++																																											
++- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`																																											
++																																											
++- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`																																											
++																																											
++### Controlling commits																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
++    steps:																																											
++      - uses: actions/checkout@v2																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: |																																											
++          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'																																											
++          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'																																											
++          date +%s > report.txt																																											
++          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"																																											
++          date +%s > new-report.txt																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: date +%s > report.txt																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++### Ignoring files																																											
++																																											
++If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.																																											
++																																											
++### Create a project card																																											
++																																											
++To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1																																											
++        with:																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++## Reference Example																																											
++																																											
++The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.																																											
++Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

++	Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																										
++	 																																										
++	  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																										
++	 																																										
++	  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																										
++	 																																										
++	NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																										
++

So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.

++		Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.																																									
++		 																																									
++		  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.																																									
++		 																																									
++		  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.																																									
++		 																																									
++		NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.																																									
++		 																																									
++		In anticipating for your urgent cooperation																																									
++		 																																									
++		Thank you, God Bless America.

++		Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																									
++		Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																									
++		for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																									
++		payment due to insufficient funds.																																									
++		Total charges for 1 items $36																																									
++		The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																									
++		Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																									
++		NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																									
++		of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																									
++		Here’s what you need to																																									
++		do immediately:																																									
++		Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																									
++		and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																									
++		account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																									
++		been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																									
++		way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																									
++		branch.																																									
++		It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																									
++		#barcode																																									
++		Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																									
++		the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																									
++		subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																									
++		overdrawn.																																									
++		Here are your current																																									
++		account settings:																																									
++		Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																									
++		up this service.

++### Action outputs																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: |																																											
++          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"																																											
++          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++### Action behaviour																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++																																											
++How the action behaves:																																											
++																																											
++- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.																																											
++- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.																																											
++																																											
++For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).																																											
++																																											
++#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.																																											
++																																											
++To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.																																											
++																																											
++- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`																																											
++																																											
++- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`																																											
++																																											
++- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`																																											
++																																											
++### Controlling commits																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
++    steps:																																											
++      - uses: actions/checkout@v2																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: |																																											
++          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'																																											
++          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'																																											
++          date +%s > report.txt																																											
++          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"																																											
++          date +%s > new-report.txt																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        run: date +%s > report.txt																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++### Ignoring files																																											
++																																											
++If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.																																											
++																																											
++### Create a project card																																											
++																																											
++To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.																																											
++																																											
++```yml																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3																																											
++																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1																																											
++        with:																																											
+#NAME?																																											
+#NAME?																																											
++          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}																																											
++```																																											
++																																											
++## Reference Example																																											
++																																											
++The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.																																											
++Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="./assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

 <img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="300" height="150" /> 

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

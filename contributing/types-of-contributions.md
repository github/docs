# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the GitHub Docs content and site in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on docs.github.com! Our small, but mighty :muscle: docs team is maintaining this repo; to preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:

We cannot accept contributions to the [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference). If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue in the [github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/new?template=schema-inaccuracy.md) repository.

### :question: Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please [contact GitHub Support directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Any issues or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact [Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=docs-contributing-guide).

### :earth_asia: Translations

This website is internationalized and available in multiple languages. The source content in this repository is written in English. We automate translations through an internal process, working with professional translators to localize the English content.

**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**.

### :balance_scale: Site Policy
GitHub's site policies are published on docs.github.com, too!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

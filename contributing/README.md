# Contributing to github/docs

Check out our [contributing guide](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see all the ways you can participate in the GitHub docs community :sparkling_heart:

Visit "[Contributing to GitHub Docs documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing)" for additional information about how to write and collaborate the GitHub Docs way.

Here, you'll find additional information that might be helpful as you work on a pull request in this repo.

- [development](./development.md) - steps for getting this app running on your local machine
- [deployments](./deployments.md) - how our staging and production environments work
- [liquid helpers](./liquid-helpers.md) - using liquid helpers for versioning in our docs
- [translations guide for writers](./translations-for-writers.md) - making sure your content is ready to be translated
- [node versions](./node-versions.md) - our site runs on Node.js
- [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) - some help for troubleshooting failed and stalled status checks
- [Reusables](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/creating-reusable-content#about-reusables) - We create reusables and call them from articles to help us keep content that is used in multiple places up to date.
- [Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/creating-reusable-content#about-variables) - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.
- [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.

You can also read the READMEs in the `src/` directory to learn more about the features of the docs site.

I don't have specific information about GitHub Codespace or GitHub Copilot in the provided knowledge sources. The documents I have access to are focused on Docker products and features, including Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, Docker Build Cloud, Docker Scout, and Testcontainers Cloud.

GitHub Codespace and GitHub Copilot appear to be products from GitHub, which are separate from Docker's offerings. If you have questions about Docker products or how to use Docker with your development environment, I'd be happy to help with that instead.

For example, I can provide information about:
- Docker Desktop and its features
- Docker subscription plans
- Docker Extensions
- Docker Build Cloud
- Working with containers in development environments

Is there something specific about Docker that you'd like to know about?

您可以在 {% data variables.product.product_name %} 上使用模板仓库作为 {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} 上作业的起始代码。 模板仓库可包含学生的 boilerplate 代码、文档和其他资源。 更多信息请参阅“[创建模板仓库](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)”。

要将模板仓库用于作业，模板仓库必须由您的组织拥有，或者模板仓库的可见性必须是公共的。

You can reuse an existing assignment, even if it uses a template repository, in any other classroom that you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see "[Reuse an assignment](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment)."

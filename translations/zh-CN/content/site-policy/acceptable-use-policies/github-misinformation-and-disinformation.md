- Inaccurate or scientifically unsupported medical claims that endanger public health or safety
- Manipulated media, whether audio or visual, likely to mislead or deceive in a way that may harm the public interest

鼓励积极参与表达想法、观点和经验，不得质疑个人帐户或言论。 We generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our [Acceptable Use Polices](/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies), and we consider context to be important in how information is received and understood. When reviewing content under this policy, GitHub will consider the impact of various factors that may help to orient the viewer, such as whether the content has been provided with clear disclaimers, citations to credible sources, or includes other details that clarify the accuracy of the information being shared.

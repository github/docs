## 关于 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} 中的警报

您可以设置 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}，以使用默认 {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} 分析、第三方分析或多种类型的分析来检查仓库中的代码。 分析完成后，生成的警报将并排显示在仓库的安全视图中。 第三方工具或自定义查询的结果可能不包括您在 {% data variables.product.company_short %} 的默认 {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} 分析所检测的警报中看到的所有属性。 更多信息请参阅“[为仓库设置 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}](/code-security/secure-coding/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository)”。

默认情况下， {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} 定期在默认分支和拉取请求中分析您的代码。 有关管理拉取请求中的警报的更多信息，请参阅“[对拉取请求中的 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} 警报分类](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)”。

## About alert details

每个警报都会高亮显示代码的问题以及识别该问题的工具名称。 You can see the line of code that triggered the alert, as well as properties of the alert, such as the alert severity{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}, security severity,{% endif %} and the nature of the problem. 警报还会告知该问题第一次被引入的时间。 对于由 {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} 分析确定的警报，您还会看到如何解决问题的信息。

If you set up {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} using {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}, you can also find data-flow problems in your code. 数据流分析将查找代码中的潜在安全问题，例如：不安全地使用数据、将危险参数传递给函数以及泄漏敏感信息。

当 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} 报告数据流警报时，{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} 将显示数据在代码中如何移动。 {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} 可用于识别泄露敏感信息的代码区域，以及可能成为恶意用户攻击切入点的代码区域。

### About severity levels

Alert severity levels may be `Error`, `Warning`, or `Note`.

If {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is enabled as a pull request check, the check will fail if it detects any results with a severity of `error`. {% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}You can specify which severity level of code scanning alerts causes a check failure. For more information, see "[Defining the severities causing pull request check failure](/code-security/secure-coding/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure)."{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}
### About security severity levels

{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} displays security severity levels for alerts that are generated by security queries. Security severity levels can be `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.

To calculate the security severity of an alert, we use Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) data. CVSS is an open framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities, and is commonly used by other security products to score alerts. For more information about how severity levels are calculated, see [this blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-07-19-codeql-code-scanning-new-severity-levels-for-security-alerts/).

By default, any {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} results with a security severity of `Critical` or `High` will cause a check failure. You can specify which security severity level for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} results should cause a check failure. For more information, see "[Defining the severities causing pull request check failure](/code-security/secure-coding/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#defining-the-severities-causing-pull-request-check-failure)."{% endif %}

### About labels for alerts that are not found in application code

{% data variables.product.product_name %} assigns a category label to alerts that are not found in application code. The label relates to the location of the alert.

- **Generated**: Code generated by the build process
- **Test**: Test code
- **Library**: Library or third-party code
- **Documentation**: Documentation

{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_capc %} categorizes files by file path. You cannot manually categorize source files.

Here is an example from the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alert list of an alert marked as occurring in library code.

![Code scanning library alert in list](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-library-alert-index.png)

On the alert page, you can see that the filepath is marked as library code (`Library` label).

## About experimental alerts

{% data reusables.code-scanning.beta-codeql-ml-queries %}

In repositories that run {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} using the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} action, you may see some alerts that are marked as experimental. These are alerts that were found using a machine learning model to extend the capabilities of an existing {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query.

![Code scanning experimental alert in list](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-experimental-alert-list.png)

### Benefits of using machine learning models to extend queries

Queries that use machine learning models are capable of finding vulnerabilities in code that was written using frameworks and libraries that the original query writer did not include.

Each of the security queries for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} identifies code that's vulnerable to a specific type of attack. Security researchers write the queries and include the most common frameworks and libraries. So each existing query finds vulnerable uses of common frameworks and libraries. However, developers use many different frameworks and libraries, and a manually maintained query cannot include them all. Consequently, manually maintained queries do not provide coverage for all frameworks and libraries.

{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} uses a machine learning model to extend an existing security query to cover a wider range of frameworks and libraries. The machine learning model is trained to detect problems in code it's never seen before. Queries that use the model will find results for frameworks and libraries that are not described in the original query.

### Alerts identified using machine learning

Alerts found using a machine learning model are tagged as "Experimental alerts" to show that the technology is under active development. These alerts have a higher rate of false positive results than the queries they are based on. The machine learning model will improve based on user actions such as marking a poor result as a false positive or fixing a good result.

## Enabling experimental alerts

The default {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query suites do not include any queries that use machine learning to generate experimental alerts. To run machine learning queries during {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} you need to run the additional queries contained in one of the following query suites.

{% data reusables.code-scanning.codeql-query-suites %}

When you update your workflow to run an additional query suite this will increase the analysis time.

``` yaml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v1
  with:
    # Run extended queries including queries using machine learning
    queries: security-extended
```

更多信息请参阅“[配置代码扫描](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs)”。

## Disabling experimental alerts

The simplest way to disable queries that use machine learning to generate experimental alerts is to stop running the `security-extended` or `security-and-quality` query suite. In the example above, you would comment out the `queries` line. If you need to continue to run the `security-extended` or `security-and-quality` suite and the machine learning queries are causing problems, then you can open a ticket with [{% data variables.product.company_short %} support](https://support.github.com/contact) with the following details.

- Ticket title: "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}: removal from experimental alerts beta"
- Specify details of the repositories or organizations that are affected
- Request an escalation to engineering

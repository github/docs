    - Support bundles could include sensitive files if {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} was enabled.
    - 包已更新到最新的安全版本。
  bugs:
    - The options to enable `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1` in the Privacy settings of the Management Console were shown, although removal of those protocol versions occurred in an earlier release.
    - In a HA environment, configuring MSSQL replication could require additional manual steps after enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for the first time.
    - A subset of internal configuration files are more reliably updated after a hotpatch.
    - The `ghe-run-migrations` script would sometimes fail to generate temporary certificate names correctly.
    - In a cluster environment, Git LFS operations could fail with failed internal API calls that crossed multiple web nodes.
    - Pre-receive hooks that used `gpg --import` timed out due to insufficient `syscall` privileges.
    - In some cluster topologies, webhook delivery information was not available.
    - In HA configurations, tearing down a replica would fail if {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} had previously been enabled.
    - Elasticsearch health checks would not allow a yellow cluster status when running migrations.
    - Organizations created as a result of a user transforming their user account into an organization were not added to the global enterprise account.
    - When using `ghe-migrator` or exporting from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, a long-running export would fail when data was deleted mid-export.
    - Links to inaccessible pages were removed.
    - Adding a team as a reviewer to a pull request would sometimes show the incorrect number of members on that team.
    - A large number of dormant users could cause a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} configuration to fail.
    - The "Feature & beta enrollments" page in the Site admin web UI was incorrectly available.
    - The "Site admin mode" link in the site footer did not change state when clicked.
  changes:
    - Memcached connection limits were increased to better accommodate large cluster topologies.
    - More effectively identify and delete webhook logs that are outside of the webhook log retention window.
    - The Dependency Graph API previously ran with a statically defined port.
    - The default shard counts for cluster-related Elasticsearch shard settings have been updated.
    - The “Triage” and “Maintain” team roles are preserved during repository migrations.
    - '`NotProcessedError` exceptions were occurring unnecessarily.'
    - Performance has been improved for web requests made by enterprise owners.
  known_issues:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm 注册表不再返回元数据响应的时间值。这样做是为了大幅改善性能。作为元数据响应的一部分，我们继续拥有返回时间值所需的所有数据，并将在我们解决现有性能问题后恢复返回这个值。'
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - 自定义防火墙规则在升级过程中被删除。
    - Git LFS 跟踪的文件[通过 Web 界面上传](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) 被错误地直接添加到仓库。
    - 如果议题包含文件路径长于 255 个字符的同一仓库中 blob 的永久链接，则议题无法关闭。
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

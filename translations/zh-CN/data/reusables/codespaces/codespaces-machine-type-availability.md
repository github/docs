Your choice of available machine types may be limited by a policy configured for your organization, or by a minimum machine type specification for your repository. For more information, see "[Restricting access to machine types](/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-access-to-machine-types)" and "[Setting a minimum specification for codespace machines](/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-a-minimum-specification-for-codespace-machines)."

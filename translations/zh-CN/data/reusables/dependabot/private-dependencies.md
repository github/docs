Currently, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_version_updates %} doesn't support manifest or lock files that contain any private git dependencies or private git registries. This is because, when running version updates, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_short %} must be able to resolve all dependencies from their source to verify that version updates have been successful.

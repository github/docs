You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository. Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own. For more information, see "[Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?](/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)"

You can pin any public gist you own.

Pinned items include important information about the item, like the number of stars a repository has received or the first few lines of a gist. Once you pin items to your profile, the "Pinned" section replaces the "Popular repositories" section on your profile.

You can reorder the items in the "Pinned" section. In the upper-right corner of a pin, click {% octicon "grabber" aria-label="The grabber symbol" %}  and drag the pin to a new location.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}

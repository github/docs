### About stars

Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %}.

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
You can star repositories and topics to discover similar projects on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you star repositories or topics, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may recommend related content in the discovery view of your news feed. For more information, see "[Finding ways to contribute to open source on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/getting-started-with-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)".
{% endif %}

Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, [Explore](https://github.com/explore) shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have.

### Starring a repository

Starring a repository is a simple two-step process.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Star**. ![Starring a repository](/assets/images/help/stars/starring-a-repository.png)
1. Optionally, to unstar a previously starred repository, click **Unstar**. ![Untarring a repository](/assets/images/help/stars/unstarring-a-repository.png)

### Searching stars

You can use the search bar on your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %} to quickly find repositories and topics you've starred.

1. Go to your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %}.
1. Use the search bar to find your starred repositories or topics by their name. ![Searching through stars](/assets/images/help/stars/stars_search_bar.png)

The search bar only searches based on the name of a repository or topic, and not on any other qualifiers (such as the size of the repository or when it was last updated).

### Sorting and filtering stars

You can use sorting or filtering to customize how you see starred repositories and topics on your stars page.

1. Go to your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %}.
1. To sort stars, select the **Sort** drop-down menu, then select **Recently starred**, **Recently active**, or **Most stars**. ![Sorting stars](/assets/images/help/stars/stars_sort_menu.png)
1. To filter your list of stars based on their language, click on the desired language under **Filter by languages**. ![Filter stars by language](/assets/images/help/stars/stars_filter_language.png)
1. To filter your list of stars based on repository or topic, click on the desired option. ![Filter stars by topic](/assets/images/help/stars/stars_filter_topic.png)

2. [Create](/articles/creating-new-files), [edit](/articles/editing-files), [rename](/articles/renaming-a-file), [move](/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location), or [delete](/articles/deleting-files) files.
3. [Send a pull request](/articles/creating-a-pull-request) from your branch with your proposed changes to kick off a discussion.

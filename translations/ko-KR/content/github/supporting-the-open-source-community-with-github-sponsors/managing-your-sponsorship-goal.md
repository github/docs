### About sponsorship goals

You can set a funding goal for your sponsored account and share the goal with your community. Goals help you understand the impact you have in the open source community and build up your presence in the {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} program.

Your goal can set a target for the number of sponsors you want to have or the amount of money you want to earn each month. You can only set one goal up at a time. After you reach a goal, you can set another goal.

{% note %}

**Note:** Goals are intended to help people track momentum so only monthly sponsors contribute toward your goal.

### Setting a goal

{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-your-goals-tab %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.set-a-goal %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.select-goal-type %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.publish-goal %}

### Editing a goal

When you edit a goal, you can't choose a goal you've already achieved. For example, if you already have 5 sponsors, you can't edit your goal so that you're aiming for 4 sponsors.

{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-your-goals-tab %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.edit-goal %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.select-goal-type %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.publish-goal %}

### Retiring a goal

After you retire a goal, you won't be able to reactivate the goal. You must create a new goal instead.

{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.navigate-to-your-goals-tab %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.edit-goal %}
{% data reusables.sponsors.retire-goal %}

The community profile checklist checks to see if a project includes recommended community health files, such as README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, or CONTRIBUTING, in a supported location. For more information, see "[Accessing a project's community profile](/articles/accessing-a-project-s-community-profile)."

### Using the community profile checklist as a repository maintainer

As a repository maintainer, use the community profile checklist to see if your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see "[Building community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)" in the Open Source Guides.

If a project doesn't have a recommended file, you can click **Add** to draft and submit a file.

{% data reusables.repositories.valid-community-issues %} For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."

### Using the community profile checklist as a community member or collaborator

As a potential contributor, use the community profile checklist to see if a project meets the recommended community standards and decide if you'd like to contribute. For more information, see "[How to contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#anatomy-of-an-open-source-project)" in the Open Source Guides.

If a project doesn't have a recommended file, you can click **Propose** to draft and submit a file to the repository maintainer for approval.

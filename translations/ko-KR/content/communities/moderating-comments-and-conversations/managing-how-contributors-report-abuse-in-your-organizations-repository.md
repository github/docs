{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-moderation-reported-content %}
4. Under "Reported content", select or unselect **Accept content reports from collaborators and prior contributors**. ![Checkbox for opting into or out of reported content for a repository](/assets/images/help/repository/reported-content-opt-in-checkbox.png)

This will not unpublish existing sites.
        - 'Repositories that use {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} can now [build and deploy from any branch](/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites).'

        - 'It''s now easier and faster to [reference issues or pull requests](/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#referencing-issues-and-pull-requests), with search across multiple words after the "#".'

      heading: Administration changes
      notes:
        - Enterprise owners can now publish a mandatory message. The message is shown to all users and they must acknowledge it. This can be used to display important information, terms of service or policies.

      heading: Default branch renaming
      notes:
        - |
          Enterprise and organization owners can now set the default branch name for new repositories. Enterprise owners can also enforce their choice of default branch name across all organizations or allow individual organizations to choose their own.

          This change is one of many changes {% data variables.product.company_short %} is making to support projects and maintainers that want to rename their default branch. To learn more, see [github/renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming).

  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - 'A warning message `jq: error (at <stdin>:0): Cannot index number with string "settings"` could occur during replica promotion.'
    - Continuously restoring backups to a cluster could fail due to MySQL replicas failing to connect to the primary.
    - Syntax highlighting could fail due to the Treelights container running out of memory.
    - Visiting the `/settings/emails` page would store state that could cause improper redirects when logging out and logging back in.
    - Dependency graph alerts weren't shown for some components whose advisories have upper case package names in `vulnerable_version_ranges`.
    - GitHub integration apps were not able to notify teams when mentioned directly via an at-mention in an issue comment.
    - When ghe-migrator encountered import errors, it would sometimes abort the entire process, and the logs did not include enough context.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.

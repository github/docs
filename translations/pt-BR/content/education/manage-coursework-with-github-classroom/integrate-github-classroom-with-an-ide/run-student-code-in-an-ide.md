## About student code and IDEs

If you configure an integrated development environment (IDE) for an assignment, you can run the code within the IDE. Você não precisa clonar o repositório da atividade no seu computador.

For more information about IDEs, see "[Integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an IDE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide)."

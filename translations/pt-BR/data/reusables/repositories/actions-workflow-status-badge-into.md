Status badges show whether a workflow is currently failing or passing. A common place to add a status badge is in the README.md file of your repository, but you can add it to any web page you'd like. By default, badges display the status of your default branch. You can also display the status of a workflow run for a specific branch or event using the `branch` and `event` query parameters in the URL.

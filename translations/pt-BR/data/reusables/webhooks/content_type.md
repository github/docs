Webhooks can be delivered using different content types:

- The `application/json` content type will deliver the JSON payload directly as the body of the `POST` request.
- The `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type will send the JSON payload as a form parameter called `payload`.

Choose the one that best fits your needs.

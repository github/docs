### Resolver conversas

You can resolve a conversation in a pull request if you opened the pull request or if you have write access to the repository where the pull request was opened.

To indicate that a conversation on the **Files changed** tab is complete, click **Resolve conversation**.

The entire conversation will be collapsed and marked as resolved, making it easier to find conversations that still need to be addressed.

If the suggestion in a comment is out of your pull request's scope, you can open a new issue that tracks the feedback and links back to the original comment. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Abrir um problema a partir de um comentário](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-a-comment)".

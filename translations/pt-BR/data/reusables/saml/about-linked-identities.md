You can view the single sign-on identity that a member has linked to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account. When available, the entry will include SCIM data. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Sobre o SCIM](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-scim)".

If a member links the wrong identity to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, you can revoke the linked identity to allow the member to try again.

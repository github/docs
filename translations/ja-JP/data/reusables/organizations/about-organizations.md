Your team can collaborate on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by using an organization account. Each person that uses {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} signs into a personal account. Multiple personal accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account, which owns the repositories. A subset of these personal accounts can be given the role of organization owner, which allows those people to granularly manage access to the organization's resources using sophisticated security and administrative features.

To automatically trigger a workflow, use `on` to define which events can cause the workflow to run. 使用可能なイベントの一覧は、「[ワークフローをトリガーするイベント](/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows)」を参照してください。

You can define single or multiple events that can a trigger workflow, or set a time schedule. You can also restrict the execution of a workflow to only occur for specific files, tags, or branch changes. These options are described in the following sections.

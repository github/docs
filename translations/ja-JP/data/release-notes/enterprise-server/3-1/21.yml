  security_fixes:
    - '**MEDIUM:** A security issue in nginx resolver was identified, where an attacker who could forge UDP packets from the DNS server could cause 1-byte memory overwrite, resulting in worker process crashes or other potentially damaging impacts. The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2021-23017](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23017).'
    - Updated the `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/checkout@v3` actions to address new vulnerabilities announced in the [Git security enforcement blog post](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/).
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - In some cluster topologies, the `ghe-cluster-status` command left behind empty directories in `/tmp`.
    - SNMP incorrectly logged a high number of `Cannot statfs` error messages to syslog.
    - For instances configured with SAML authentication and built-in fallback enabled, built-in users would get stuck in a “login” loop when attempting to sign in from the page generated after logging out.
    - When using SAML encrypted assertions, some assertions were not correctly marking SSH keys as verified.
    - 'The Releases page would return a 500 error when the repository has tags that contain non-ASCII characters. [Updated: 2022-06-10]'
  changes:
    - In high availability configurations, clarify that the replication overview page in the Management Console only displays the current replication configuration, not the current replication status.
    - When enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, clarify that using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token as connection string is not supported.
    - Support bundles now include the row count of tables stored in MySQL.
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

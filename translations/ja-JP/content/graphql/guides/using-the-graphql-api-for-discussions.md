title: Using the GraphQL API for Discussions
intro: Learn how to use the GitHub Discussions GraphQL API.
versions:
  free-pro-team: '*'
---

The {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} GraphQL API allows you to get, create, edit, and delete discussion posts. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, see "[‎About discussions](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)."

This API is available for authenticated users, OAuth Apps, and GitHub Apps. Access tokens require the `repo` scope for private repositories and the `public_repo` scope for public repositories. For more information, see "[Scopes for OAuth apps](/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)."

To use this API, you must include `GraphQL-Features: discussions_api` in the `HTTP` header.

## フィールド

### Repository.discussions

List the discussions within a repository. If `categoryId` is specified, only results within that category will be returned.

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussions(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
  categoryId: ID = null,
  orderBy: DiscussionOrder = {field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC}
) : Discussion
```

#### DiscussionOrder

```graphql
"""
Ways in which discussions can be ordered.
"""
input DiscussionOrder {
  """
  The field by which to order discussions.
  """
  field: DiscussionOrderField!

  """
  The direction in which to order discussions by the specified field.
  """
  direction: OrderDirection!
}
```

```graphql
"""
Properties by which discussion connections can be ordered.
"""
enum DiscussionOrderField {
  """
  Order discussions by creation time.
  """
  CREATED_AT

  """
  Order discussions by most recent modification time.
  """
  UPDATED_AT
}
```

### Repository.discussionCategories

Return the available discussion categories defined within this repository. Each repository may have up to 10 categories. For more information about discussion categories, see "[About discussions](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions#about-categories-and-formats-for-discussions)."

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussionCategories(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
) : DiscussionCategoryConnection!
```

### Repository.discussion

ディスカッションの取得. Returns `null` if discussion with the specified ID does not exist.

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussion(number: Int!) : Discussion
```

### Repository.pinnedDiscussions

Return discussions pinned to this repository, ordered by pin position.

_Signature:_

```graphql
pinnedDiscussions(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
) : PinnedDiscussionConnection!
```

## オブジェクト

**Note:** For brevity, connection types are not expanded here. Each connection type mentioned in the schema follows the same pattern as other connections in the GraphQL API. 詳しい情報については「[GraphQLの紹介](/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql#connection)」を参照してください。

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "github", name: "some-repo") {
    discussions(first: 10) {
      # type: DiscussionConnection
      totalCount # Int!

      pageInfo {
        # type: PageInfo (from the public schema)
        startCursor
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }

      edges {
        # type: DiscussionEdge
        cursor
        node {
          # type: Discussion
          id
        }
      }

      nodes {
        # type: Discussion
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ミューテーション

These mutations follow the same implementation pattern that other mutations in the GraphQL API. Each mutation accepts a single argument of an `Input` type, named after the mutation, and returns a `Payload` type containing the fields specified.

For example, this is a basic `createDiscussion` mutation that will create a new discussion:

```graphql
mutation {
  # input type: CreateDiscussionInput
  createDiscussion(input: {repositoryId: "1234", categoryId: "5678", body: "The body", title: "The title"}) {

    # response type: CreateDiscussionPayload
    discussion {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## 検索

Discussion may be returned from the top-level `search` field. To search for discussion, specify `type` as `DISCUSSION`. The `SearchResultItemConnection` type has a `discussionCount` field to report the number of returned discussions, and the `Discussion` type is added to the `SearchResultItem` union. For more information, see ["Queries](/graphql/reference/queries#searchresultitemconnection)."

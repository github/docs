### Public information
You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, [you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile](https://github.com/settings/emails). You can also [update your local Git configuration to use your private email address](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). コミットメッセージ内のメールアドレスに関する詳細については、[こちら](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)を参照してください。

Please note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.

### Third-party applications
We share your Personal Data with third parties when you tell us to do so.

Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share your Personal Data. たとえば、お客様がOrganizationに参加する場合、OrganizationのオーナーにOrganizationのアクセスログを使ってお客様のアクティビティを表示する権限を付与したい旨を指示できます。

You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products" to your Account. このDeveloper Productsは、お客様がGitHubを利用するにあたって、必ずしも必要なものではありません。 We will share your Personal Data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of Personal Data you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/rest/reference/users) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.

### Organizations with which you engage
You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your Personal Data. If you collaborate on or become a member of an organization, then its Account owners may receive your Personal Data. When you accept an invitation to an organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see [About Organization Membership](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership)).

If GitHub processes Personal Data other than your profile information, such as information about you GitHub receives from [third parties](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your Personal Data by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).

You may manage your communication preferences in your [profile](https://github.com/settings/emails).

By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user's email address, such as commit messages. See more details regarding [setting your commit email address](https://github.com/settings/emails).

Depending on your [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), GitHub may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 当社がお客様に送信するマーケティングemailの文末には、「サブスクライブ解除」のリンクがあります。

当社から、サポートチームまたはシステムemailなどの重要なコミュニケーションの受け取りを解除することはできません。ですが、その他のコミュニケーションについては、プロフィールの通知設定を変更することで解除できます。

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our  Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, compile statistical reports, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We use our own cookies and do not use any third-party service providers in this context. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use our Service. [GitHub上のクッキー](/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies#cookies-on-github)については、[GitHubの当社のサブプロセッサーおよびクッキー](/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies)のページで、当社が設定するクッキー、クッキーの必要性、およびクッキーの有効期限について詳しく説明しています。

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

### DNT

「[Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)」(DNT) とは、オンラインサービスに対して、第三者のトラッキングサービスからお客様のオンライン活動についての特定の種類の情報を収集して共有することを望まない場合に、ブラウザで設定できるプライバシー設定です。 GitHubは、ブラウザのDNTシグナルに応答し、[DNTシグナルへの応答についてのW3C基準](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/)に従います。 トラッキングを望まないことを通知するようブラウザに対して設定したい場合、この通知を有効化する方法について、ブラウザのドキュメントをご確認ください。 [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)など、トラッキングをブロックする良いアプリケーションもあります。

## Retention of Personal Data
We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your Personal Data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes.

## お客様情報についての当社の保護方法
GitHub takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your Personal Data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account has private repositories, you control the access to that Content. GitHub personnel does not access private repository content except for
- security purposes,
- automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
- リポジトリのオーナーをサポートするため
- サービスの完全性を維持するため
- to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law,
- or with your consent.

Github will provide notice regarding private repository access where not prohibited by law or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

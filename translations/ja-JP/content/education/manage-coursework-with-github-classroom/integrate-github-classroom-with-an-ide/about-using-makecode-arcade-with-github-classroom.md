## About MakeCode Arcade

MakeCode Arcade is an online integrated development environment (IDE) for developing retro arcade games using drag-and-drop block programming and JavaScript. Students can write, edit, run, test, and debug code in a browser with MakeCode Arcade. For more information about IDEs and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, see "[Integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an IDE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide)."

{% data reusables.classroom.readme-contains-button-for-online-ide %}

The first time the student clicks the button to visit MakeCode Arcade, the student must sign into MakeCode Arcade with {% data variables.product.product_name %} credentials. After signing in, the student will have access to a development environment containing the code from the assignment repository, fully configured on MakeCode Arcade.

For more information about working on MakeCode Arcade, see the [MakeCode Arcade Tour](https://arcade.makecode.com/ide-tour) and [documentation](https://arcade.makecode.com/docs) on the MakeCode Arcade website.

MakeCode Arcade does not support multiplayer-editing for group assignments. Instead, students can collaborate with Git and {% data variables.product.product_name %} features like branches and pull requests.

## About submission of assignments with MakeCode Arcade

By default, MakeCode Arcade is configured to push to the assignment repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. After making progress on an assignment with MakeCode Arcade, students should push changes to {% data variables.location.product_location %} using the {% octicon "mark-github" aria-label="The GitHub mark" %}{% octicon "arrow-up" aria-label="The up arrow icon" %} button at the bottom of the screen.

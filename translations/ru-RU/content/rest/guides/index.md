This section of the documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with real-world {% data variables.product.product_name %} API applications. We'll cover everything you need to know, from authentication, to manipulating results, to combining results with other apps. Every tutorial here will have a project, and every project will be stored and documented in our public [platform-samples](https://github.com/github/platform-samples) repository. ![The Electrocat](/assets/images/electrocat.png)

### Unclear academic affiliation documents

If the image you uploaded doesn't clearly identify your current academic status, we require further proof of your academic status. {% data reusables.education.upload-proof-reapply %}

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

### Using an academic email with an unverified domain

If your academic email address has an unverified domain, we require further proof of your academic status. {% data reusables.education.upload-proof-reapply %}

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

### Using an academic email from a school with lax email policies

If your school issues email addresses prior to paid student enrollment, we require further proof of your academic status. {% data reusables.education.upload-proof-reapply %}

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

If you have other questions or concerns about the school domain please ask your school IT staff to contact us.

### Academic email address already used

If your academic email address was already used to request a {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %} for a different {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account, you cannot reuse the academic email address to successfully apply for another {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %} until that discount expires.

{% note %}

**Note:** It is against the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} [Terms of Service](/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements) to maintain more than one individual account.

{% endnote %}

If you have more than one personal user account, you must merge your accounts. To retain the discount, keep the account that was granted the discount. You can rename the retained account and keep your contribution history by adding all your email addresses to the retained account.

### Ineligible student status

You're ineligible for a {% data variables.product.prodname_student_pack %} if:

- You're under 13 years old.

### About sponsorships

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %}

You can sponsor an account on behalf of your user account to invest in projects that you personally benefit from. You can sponsor an account on behalf of your organization for many reasons.
- Sustaining specific libraries that your organization's work depends on
- Investing in the ecosystem you rely on as a organization (such as blockchain)
- Developing brand awareness as an organization that values open source
- Thanking open source developers for building libraries that complement the product your organization offers

You use your normal payment method to sponsor an account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If your organization wants to pay by invoice, [contact us](https://support.github.com/contact/org-sponsors-waitlist).

{% data reusables.sponsors.no-fees %} For more information, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}](/articles/about-billing-for-github-sponsors)."

When you sponsor an account the change is effective immediately, unless you are sponsoring on behalf of an organization that pays by invoice. {% data reusables.sponsors.prorated-sponsorship %} Your sponsorship is included in the next scheduled payment to the sponsored account.

{% data reusables.sponsors.manage-updates-for-orgs %}

If the sponsored account retires your tier, the tier will remain in place for you until you choose a different tier or cancel your subscription. For more information, see "[Upgrading a sponsorship](/articles/upgrading-a-sponsorship)" and "[Downgrading a sponsorship](/articles/downgrading-a-sponsorship)."

If the account you want to sponsor does not have a profile on {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, you can encourage the account to join. For more information, see "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your user account](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-user-account)" and "[Setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for your organization](/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is not responsible for how developers represent themselves nor does {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} endorse any sponsored open source projects. The claims are solely the responsibility of the developer receiving the funds. Make sure you trust a person before offering a sponsorship.

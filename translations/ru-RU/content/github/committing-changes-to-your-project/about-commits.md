### About commits

{% data reusables.commits.about-commits %}

You can add a co-author on any commits you collaborate on. For more information, see "[Creating a commit with multiple authors](/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)."

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
You can also create a commit on behalf of an organization. For more information, see "[Creating a commit on behalf of an organization](/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-a-commit-on-behalf-of-an-organization)."{% endif %}

Rebasing allows you to change a series of commits and can modify the order of the commits in your timeline. For more information, see "[About git rebase](/github/using-git/about-git-rebase)."

For choice and flexibility in how and when you use {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can configure theme settings to change how {% data variables.product.product_name %} looks to you. You can choose from two themes, light and dark, or you can configure {% data variables.product.product_name %} to follow your system settings. Some developers use dark theme for personal preference, to reduce power consumption on certain devices, or to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.

intro: Release candidate versions should be tested on non-production environments. For more information about the Release Candidate Program, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2020-12-03-improving-the-ghes-release-process-release-candidates/) or "[About upgrades to new releases](/admin/overview/about-upgrades-to-new-releases)".
sections:
  bugs:
    - The format of several log files have changed, including the addition of a PID for different log types. This does not affect how GitHub Enterprise Support uses support bundles to troubleshoot issues.
    - A PATCH request to the webhook configuration API no longer erases the webhook secret.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Release Candidate 1 does not support Cluster mode.
    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.blog/2016-02-18-upload-files-to-your-repositories/) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - Following an unsuccessful attempt to set up Actions, if you then disable Actions you will not be able to create the first user and use the appliance
    - The "Mandatory message viewed" audit log event is not being saved
    - '`ghe-config-apply` must be run on a replica during first setup before `ghe-repl-setup` can be run to start replication.'
    - Backup-utils can trigger unnecessary emails to administrators
    - Incorrect Packages settings are being displayed in the Organization member view page
    - After removing oneself as an Enterprise Owner, you are redirected to a 404 page. The operation is successful.
    - '`ghe-config-apply` occassionally fails with `ERROR: Failure waiting for nomad jobs to apply` until the Nomad job queue is cleared. This currently requires as admin to delete `/etc/nomad-jobs/queue`.'
    - When configuring a multiple replica node, the status of the replica can be incorrectly synchronized.
    - Customers attempting to restore a 3.0 backup to a new instance should not pre-configure the instance, as it may lead to a bad state for user logins. We recommend restoring to a fresh, unconfigured instance.
    - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 release candidates are not yet available in the Azure marketplace. To test release candidates in staging environments, start a 2.21 or 2.22 instance, and then upgrade it with the Azure upgrade package on the download page.
    - The image and upgrade package download size has increased. Customers on slow internet connections may find the packages take longer to download.

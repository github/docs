For each group assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} automatically creates a single shared repository for the team to access. The repository can be empty, or you can create the repository from a template repository with starter code, documentation, tests, and other resources. The repository belongs to your organization account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} grants access to teams that students create or join when accepting the assignment.

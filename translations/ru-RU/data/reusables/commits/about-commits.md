Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies:

- The specific changes
- When the changes were made
- Who created the changes

When you make a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes.

Anyone who contributes to an open source project and lives in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored developer. Contributions include but are not limited to bug reports, issue triage, code, documentation, leadership, business development, project management, mentorship, and design. If you live in a region that isn't already supported by {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, you can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the beta of {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}.

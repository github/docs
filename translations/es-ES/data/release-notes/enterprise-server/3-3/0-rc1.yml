  features:
    - heading: 'Security Manager role'
      notes:
        - "Organization owners can now grant teams the access to manage security alerts and settings on their repositories. The \"security manager\" role can be applied to any team and grants the team's members the following access:\n\n- Read access on all repositories in the organization.\n- Write access on all security alerts in the organization.\n- Access to the organization-level security tab.\n- Write access on security settings at the organization level.\n- Write access on security settings at the repository level.\n\nFor more information, see \"[Managing security managers in your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization).\"\n"
    - heading: 'Ephemeral self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions & new webhooks for auto-scaling'
      notes:
        - "{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} now supports ephemeral (single job) self-hosted runners and a new [`workflow_job`](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_job) webhook to make autoscaling runners easier.\n\nEphemeral runners are good for self-managed environments where each job is required to run on a clean image. After a job is run, ephemeral runners are automatically unregistered from {% data variables.product.product_location %}, allowing you to perform any post-job management.\n\nYou can combine ephemeral runners with the new `workflow_job` webhook to automatically scale self-hosted runners in response to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} job requests.\n\nFor more information, see \"[Autoscaling with self-hosted runners](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners)\" and \"[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#workflow_job).\"\n"
    - heading: 'Dark high contrast theme'
      notes:
        - "A dark high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements, is now available on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3. This release also includes improvements to the color system across all {% data variables.product.company_short %} themes.\n\n![Animated image of switching between dark default theme and dark high contrast on the appearance settings page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/334891/123645834-ad096c00-d7f4-11eb-85c9-b2c92b00d70a.gif)\n\nFor more information about changing your theme, see \"[Managing your theme settings](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/managing-your-theme-settings).\"\n"
  changes:
    - heading: 'Cambios en la administración'
      notes:
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 includes improvements to the maintenance of repositories, especially for repositories that contain many unreachable objects. Note that the first maintenance cycle after upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may take longer than usual to complete.'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 includes the public beta of a repository cache for geographically-distributed teams and CI infrastructure. The repository cache keeps a read-only copy of your repositories available in additional geographies, which prevents clients from downloading duplicate Git content from your primary instance. For more information, see "[About repository caching](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 includes improvements to the user impersonation process. An impersonation session now requires a justification for the impersonation, actions are recorded in the audit log as being performed as an impersonated user, and the user who is impersonated will receive an email notification that they have been impersonated by an enterprise administrator. For more information, see "[Impersonating a user](/enterprise-server@3.3/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/impersonating-a-user)."'
        - 'A new stream processing service has been added to facilitate the growing set of events that are published to the audit log, including events associated with Git and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} activity.'
    - heading: 'Cambios de Token'
      notes:
        - "An expiration date can now be set for new and existing personal access tokens. Setting an expiration date on personal access tokens is highly recommended to prevent older tokens from leaking and compromising security. Token owners will receive an email when it's time to renew a token that's about to expire. Tokens that have expired can be regenerated, giving users a duplicate token with the same properties as the original.\n\nWhen using a personal access token with the {% data variables.product.company_short %} API, a new `GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` header is included in the response, which indicates the token's expiration date. For more information, see \"[Creating a personal access token](/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).\"\n"
    - heading: 'Notifications changes'
      notes:
        - 'Notification emails from discussions now include `(Discussion #xx)` in the subject, so you can recognize and filter emails that reference discussions.'
    - heading: 'Cambios de repositorios'
      notes:
        - 'Public repositories now have a `Public` label next to their names like private and internal repositories. This change makes it easier to identify public repositories and avoid accidentally committing private code.'
        - 'If you specify the exact name of a branch when using the branch selector menu, the result now appears at the top of the list of matching branches. Previously, exact branch name matches could appear at the bottom of the list.'
        - 'When viewing a branch that has a corresponding open pull request, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} now links directly to the pull request. Previously, there would be a prompt to contribute using branch comparison or to open a new pull request.'
        - 'You can now click a button to copy the full raw contents of a file to the clipboard. Previously, you would need to open the raw file, select all, and then copy. To copy the contents of a file, navigate to the file and click {% octicon "copy" aria-label="The copy icon" %} in the toolbar. Note that this feature is currently only available in some browsers.'
        - 'When creating a new release, you can now select or create the tag using a dropdown selector, rather than specifying the tag in a text field. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."'
        - 'A warning is now displayed when viewing a file that contains bidirectional Unicode text. Bidirectional Unicode text can be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears in a user interface. For example, hidden bidirectional Unicode characters can be used to swap segments of text in a file. For more information about replacing these characters, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-31-warning-about-bidirectional-unicode-text/).'
        - 'You can now use `CITATION.cff` files to let others know how you would like them to cite your work. `CITATION.cff` files are plain text files with human- and machine-readable citation information. {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} parses this information into common citation formats such as [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org) and [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX). For more information, see "[About CITATION files](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)."'
    - heading: 'Cambios en el Lenguaje de Marcado'
      notes:
        - "You can use new keyboard shortcuts for quotes and lists in Markdown files, issues, pull requests, and comments.\n\n* To add quotes, use <kbd>cmd shift .</kbd> on Mac, or <kbd>ctrl shift .</kbd> on Windows and Linux.\n* To add an ordered list, use <kbd>cmd shift 7</kbd> on Mac, or <kbd>ctrl shift 7</kbd> on Windows and Linux.\n* To add an unordered list, use <kbd>cmd shift 8</kbd> on Mac, or <kbd>ctrl shift 8</kbd> on Windows and Linux.\n\nSee \"[Keyboard shortcuts](/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)\" for a full list of available shortcuts.\n"
        - 'You can now use footnote syntax in any Markdown field. Footnotes are displayed as superscript links that you can click to jump to the referenced information, which is displayed in a new section at the bottom of the document. For more information about the syntax, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes)."'
        - 'When viewing Markdown files, you can now click {% octicon "code" aria-label="The code icon" %} in the toolbar to view the source of a Markdown file. Previously, you needed to use the blame view to link to specific line numbers in the source of a Markdown file.'
        - 'You can now add images and videos to Markdown files in gists by pasting them into the Markdown body or selecting them from the dialog at the bottom of the Markdown file. For information about supported file types, see "[Attaching files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files)."'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} now automatically generates a table of contents for Wikis, based on headings.'
        - 'When dragging and dropping files into a Markdown editor, such as images and videos, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} now uses the mouse pointer location instead of the cursor location when placing the file.'
    - heading: 'Cambios en propuestas y sollicitudes de cambio'
      notes:
        - 'You can now search issues by label using a logical OR operator. To filter issues using logical OR, use the comma syntax. For example, `label:"good first issue","bug"` will list all issues with a label of `good first issue` or `bug`. For more information, see "[Filtering and searching issues and pull requests](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#about-search-terms)."'
        - "Improvements have been made to help teams manage code review assignments. You can now:\n\n- Limit assignment to only direct members of the team.\n- Continue with automatic assignment even if one or more members of the team are already requested.\n- Keep a team assigned to review even if one or more members is newly assigned.\n\nThe timeline and reviewers sidebar on the pull request page now indicate if a review request was automatically assigned to one or more team members.\n\nFor more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-29-new-code-review-assignment-settings-and-team-filtering-improvements/).\n"
        - 'You can now filter pull request searches to only include pull requests you are directly requested to review.'
        - 'Filtered files in pull requests are now completely hidden from view, and are no longer shown as collapsed in the "Files Changed" tab. The "File Filter" menu has also been simplified. For more information, see "[Filtering files in a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/filtering-files-in-a-pull-request)."'
    - heading: 'Cambioas a las GitHub Actions'
      notes:
        - 'You can now create "composite actions" which combine multiple workflow steps into one action, and includes the ability to reference other actions. This makes it easier to reduce duplication in workflows. Previously, an action could only use scripts in its YAML definition. For more information, see "[Creating a composite action](/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)."'
        - 'Managing self-hosted runners at the enterprise level no longer requires using personal access tokens with the `admin:enterprise` scope. You can instead use the new `manage_runners:enterprise` scope to restrict the permissions on your tokens. Tokens with this scope can authenticate to [many REST API endpoints](/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#list-self-hosted-runner-groups-for-an-enterprise) to manage your enterprise''s self-hosted runners.'
        - "The audit log now includes additional events for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Audit log entries are now recorded for the following events:\n\n* A self-hosted runner is registered or removed.\n* A self-hosted runner is added to a runner group, or removed from a runner group.\n* A runner group is created or removed.\n* A workflow run is created or completed.\n* A workflow job is prepared. Importantly, this log includes the list of secrets that were provided to the runner.\n\nFor more information, see \"[Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#auditing-github-actions-events).\"\n"
        - 'Performance improvements have been made to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, which may result in higher maximum job concurrency.'
    - heading: 'Cambios a los GitHub packages'
      notes:
        - 'When a repository is deleted, any associated package files are now immediately deleted from your {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} external storage.'
    - heading: 'Cambios al Dependabot y a la gráfica de Dependencias'
      notes:
        - 'Dependency review is out of beta and is now generally available for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} customers. Dependency review provides an easy-to-understand view of dependency changes and their security impact in the "Files changed" tab of pull requests. It informs you of which dependencies were added, removed, or updated, along with vulnerability information. For more information, see "[Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request](/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-dependency-changes-in-a-pull-request)."'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} is now available as a private beta, offering both version updates and security updates for several popular ecosystems. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} requires {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and a pool of self-hosted runners configured for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} use. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} also requires {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} to be enabled. To learn more and sign up for the beta, contact the GitHub Sales team.'
    - heading: 'Cambios al escaneo de código y de secretos'
      notes:
        - 'The depth of {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}''s analysis has been improved by adding support for more [libraries and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) and increasing the coverage of our existing library and framework models. [JavaScript](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/javascript) analysis now supports most common templating languages, and [Java](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/java) now covers more than three times the endpoints of previous {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} versions. As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} can now detect even more potential sources of untrusted user data, steps through which that data flows, and potentially dangerous sinks where the data could end up. This results in an overall improvement of the quality of {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts.'
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} now supports scanning standard language features in Java 16, such as records and pattern matching. {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} is able to analyze code written in Java version 7 through 16. For more information about supported languages and frameworks, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/#id5).'
        - "Improvements have been made to the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} `on:push` trigger when code is pushed to a pull request. If an `on:push` scan returns results that are associated with a pull request, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} will now show these alerts on the pull request.\n\nSome other CI/CD systems can be exclusively configured to trigger a pipeline when code is pushed to a branch, or even exclusively for every commit. Whenever such an analysis pipeline is triggered and results are uploaded to the SARIF API, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} will also try to match the analysis results to an open pull request. If an open pull request is found, the results will be published as described above. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-27-showing-code-scanning-alerts-on-pull-requests/).\n"
        - 'You can now use the new pull request filter on the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts page to find all the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts associated with a pull request. A new "View all branch alerts" link on the pull request "Checks" tab allows you to directly view {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts with the specific pull request filter already applied. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-23-pull-request-filter-for-code-scanning-alerts/).'
        - 'User defined patterns for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} is out of beta and is now generally available for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} customers. Also new in this release is the ability to edit custom patterns defined at the repository, organization, and enterprise levels. After editing and saving a pattern, {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} searches for matches both in a repository''s entire Git history and in any new commits. Editing a pattern will close alerts previously associated with the pattern if they no longer match the updated version. Other improvements, such as dry-runs, are planned in future releases. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."'
    - heading: 'API and webhook changes'
      notes:
        - 'Most REST API previews have graduated and are now an official part of the API. Preview headers are no longer required for most REST API endpoints, but will still function as expected if you specify a graduated preview in the `Accept` header of a request. For previews that still require specifying the preview in the `Accept` header of a request, see "[API previews](/rest/overview/api-previews)."'
        - 'You can now use the REST API to configure custom autolinks to external resources. The REST API now provides beta `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE` endpoints which you can use to view, add, or delete custom autolinks associated with a repository. For more information, see "[Autolinks](/rest/reference/repos#autolinks)."'
        - 'You can now use the REST API to sync a forked repository with its upstream repository. For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos#sync-a-fork-branch-with-the-upstream-repository)" in the REST API documentation.'
        - 'Enterprise administrators on GitHub Enterprise Server can now use the REST API to enable or disable Git LFS for a repository. For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos#git-lfs)."'
        - 'You can now use the REST API to query the audit log for an enterprise. While audit log forwarding provides the ability to retain and analyze data with your own toolkit and determine patterns over time, the new endpoint can help you perform limited analysis on recent events. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} administration](/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#get-the-audit-log-for-an-enterprise)" in the REST API documentation.'
        - 'GitHub App user-to-server API requests can now read public resources using the REST API. This includes, for example, the ability to list a public repository''s issues and pull requests, and to access a public repository''s comments and content.'
        - 'When creating or updating a repository, you can now configure whether forking is allowed using the REST and GraphQL APIs. Previously, APIs for creating and updating repositories didn''t include the fields `allow_forking` (REST) or `forkingAllowed` (GraphQL). For more information, see "[Repositories](/rest/reference/repos)" in the REST API documentation and "[Repositories](/graphql/reference/objects#repository)" in the GraphQL API documentation.'
        - "A new GraphQL mutation [`createCommitOnBranch`](/graphql/reference/mutations#createcommitonbranch) makes it easier to add, update, and delete files in a branch of a repository. Compared to the REST API, you do not need to manually create blobs and trees before creating the commit. This allows you to add, update, or delete multiple files in a single API call.\n\nCommits authored using the new API are automatically GPG signed and are [marked as verified](/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} UI. GitHub Apps can use the mutation to author commits directly or [on behalf of users](/developers/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#user-to-server-requests).\n"
        - 'When a new tag is created, the [push](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) webhook payload now always includes a `head_commit` object that contains the data of the commit that the new tag points to. As a result, the `head_commit` object will always contain the commit data of the payload''s `after` commit.'
    - heading: 'Performance Changes'
      notes:
        - 'Page loads and jobs are now significantly faster for repositories with many Git refs.'
  known_issues:
    - 'On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.'
    - 'Las reglas de cortafuegos personalizadas se eliminan durante el proceso de actualización.'
    - 'Los archivos rastreados del LFS de Git que se [cargaron mediante la interface web](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) se agregaron incorrecta y directamente al repositorio.'
    - 'Las propuestas no pudieron cerrarse si contenían un permalink a un blob en el mismo repositorio en donde la ruta de archvio del blob era más grande a 255 caracteres.'
    - 'Cuando se habilita "Los usuarios pueden buscar en GitHub.com" con GitHub Connect, las propuestas en los repositorios privados e internos no se incluirán en los resultados de búsqueda de GitHub.com.'
    - 'El registor de npm del {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} ya no regresa un valor de tiempo en las respuestas de metadatos. Esto se hizo para permitir mejoras de rendimiento sustanciales. Seguimos teniendo todos los datos necesarios para devolver un valor de tiempo como parte de la respuesta de metadatos y terminaremos de devolver este valor ene l futuro una vez que hayamos resuelto los problemas de rendimiento existentes.'
    - 'Los límites de recursos que son específicos para procesar ganchos de pre-recepción podrían ocasionar que fallen algunos ganchos de pre-recepción.'

    - heading: 'Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions'
      notes:
        - "Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, support for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are now deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3.\n\nAny repositories that were already present and active on {% data variables.product.product_location %} running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.\n\nRepositories which were not present and active before upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.\n\nTo start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the **Schedule** button.\n"

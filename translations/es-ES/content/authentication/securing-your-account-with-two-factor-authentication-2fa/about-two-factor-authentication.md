For {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the second form of authentication is a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or sent as a text message (SMS){% endif %}. After you enable 2FA, {% data variables.product.product_name %} generates an authentication code any time someone attempts to sign into your account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they know both your password and have access to the authentication code on your phone.

{% data reusables.two_fa.after-2fa-add-security-key %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
In addition to security keys, you can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} for 2FA after configuring a TOTP mobile app or text messages. {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} uses public-key cryptography to secure your account, allowing you to use any mobile device that you've used to sign in to {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} as your second factor.
{% endif %}

You can also configure additional recovery methods in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials. For more information on setting up 2FA, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[Configuring two-factor authentication recovery methods](/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods)."

We **strongly** urge you to enable 2FA for the safety of your account, not only on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, but on other websites and apps that support 2FA. You can enable 2FA to access {% data variables.product.product_name %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}.

For more information, see "[Accessing {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} using two-factor authentication](/articles/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication)."

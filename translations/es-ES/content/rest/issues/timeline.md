For more information about the specific events that you can receive from the Issue Events API, see "[Issue event types](/developers/webhooks-and-events/issue-event-types)." An events API for GitHub activity outside of issues and pull requests is also available. For more information, see the "[GitHub Events API](/developers/webhooks-and-events/github-event-types)."

You can use this API to display information about issues and pull request or determine who should be notified of issue comments.

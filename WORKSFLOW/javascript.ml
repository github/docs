bookmark_border

This page details the latest major updates made to the Google Search Central documentation.

October 2022

October 24: Clarified that site names are supported at the domain level, and not at the subdomain or subdirectory level. Favicons are supported at the domain and subdomain level, and not at the subdirectory level.

October 14: Added the site name documentation.

October 13:

Added new pages for the following Google ranking updates. The information itself isn't new; the pages contain consolidated information from previous blog posts about each of these updates.

Google Search's core updates and your website

Google Search's helpful content update and your website

Google Search's product reviews update and your website

Google Search's spam updates and your website

Refreshed and renamed the Webmaster Guidelines. Notable changes include:

Google Search Essentials: Replaces the Webmaster Guidelines overview page. It includes new sections: technical requirements, spam policies, and key best practices.

Google Search technical requirements: Covers what Google needs from a web page to show it in Google Search.

Spam policies for Google web search: Replaces the Quality Guidelines section of the Webmaster Guidelines. It's been rewritten to cover more relevant examples and use more precise language. Notable updates include:

Link spam: Consolidates previous pages on Paid links and Link schemes.

Malware and malicious behaviors: Consolidates information that was previously in the Security section on our site.

Hacked content: Consolidates information that was previously in the Security section on our site.

Thin affliliate pages: Consolidates previous pages on Thin content and Affiliate programs.

New sections include:

Misleading functionality

Copyright-removal requests

Online harassment removals

Scam and fraud

Creating helpful, reliable, people-first content: This document consolidates advice from the helpful content blog post and the core updates post; none of the content is new.

October 12: Added support for image credits to the Image Metadata structured data documentation. Previously, you could only provide image credit information with IPTC photo metadata.

October 7: Added examples of product review pages to Write high quality product reviews.

September 2022

September 20: Added the Google Site Verifier user agent.

September 13:

Major update to Product structured data documentation to document requirements for eligibility to Merchant Listings experiences based on structured data. See the blog New Search Console Merchant Listings report: expanding eligibility with Product structured data for details.

Re-added the itemReviewed.datePublished property. This was removed accidentally as part of the previous update to the Fact Check structured data documentation.

September 9: Removed the datePublished property from the Fact Check structured data documentation. Currently, the ClaimReview publish date isn't used in the Fact Check rich result.

September 2: Migrated the documentation about the file types Google can index from the Search Console Help Center (the content hasn't changed).

September 1: Added more examples to show how meta descriptions could be improved.

August 2022

August 31: Added a note on the use of JavaScript to add, change, or remove meta tags on a page to the list of meta and inline tags Google Search understands.

August 29:

Added the full list of supported academic values for educationalLevel in the Learning video structured data documentation.

Clarified how to specify multiple types in Local Business structured data. If you have multiple types, specify them in an array (additionalType isn't supported).

August 24:

Added content guidelines to the Education Q&A structured data documentation.

Removed references to the deprecated International Targeting report in Search Console. The recommendations described in our documentation about managing multiregional sites and localized versions of your pages remain relevant.

August 22: Updated the Article structured data documentation to reflect that Article markup is open to all types of pages (as announced in 2020 with the page experience update).

August 11: Removed our documentation about rich-media files, such as Silverlight and Flash. Turns out it's not 2005 anymore.

August 10:

Added the gtin12 property to the Product structured data documentation. This has been supported; it's a documentation change only. Clarified that you can use the generic gtin property for all GTINs, but we recommend that you use the most specific one if possible.

Updated the dynamic rendering documentation to explain that this isn't a recommended solution, and is a workaround if you have no other choice. Instead we recommend server-side rendering, static rendering, or client-side rendering with hydration.

August 9: Added best practices for feeds to the Follow feature documentation. We recommend that you:

Use a descriptive title for your RSS feed, just like you would for a web page.

For multiple feeds, we recommend that you use a single feed. Both methods are still supported, but we clarified that a single feed is easier for you to maintain and for users to subscribe to your feed.

August 8: Clarified that we don't support the URL form for GTINs in Product structured data. Make sure to use the numerical GTIN form.

August 5: Added documentation about the pros and cons enhancement for editorial product review pages.

July 2022

July 19: Standardized how we refer to headings and title text on the page. Previously we used the word headline, but that can be confusing in other languages.

July 13: Updated the User Agent string for AdsBot Mobile Web. If you hardcoded the old value in your code, update the string to avoid potential bugs.

July 7: Added a new page for Google Search ranking updates. This is not new information; it's a compiled list of things we've previously confirmed on our blog or on Twitter.

July 6: Reorganized the navigational structure to be based on topic instead of level. Removed duplicate guides that were aimed at basic or beginner level, as these documents were duplicating guidance already explained in the SEO Starter Guide.

July 4: Clarified that you must add three courses to be eligible for the Course rich result. This is not a new requirement; it was previously only documented in the Carousel documentation.

June 2022

June 30: Added information about using JavaScript to inject canonical link tags.

June 23: Added information about how many bytes of textual content, such as HTML, Googlebot will crawl. For FAQs on the matter, check out our blog post.

June 22: Updated the Job Posting documentation to specify that when you use the jobLocation property, you must also include the addressCountry property.

June 17: Clarified that product rich results support pages that focus on a single product, and that includes product variants where each product variant has a distinct URL.

June 10: Documented new Vary: Cookie support for signed exchanges.

June 3: Added a best practice for script or language mismatches in titles. For <title> elements, use the same script and language as the page's primary content.

June 1:

Added new author markup best practices to the Article structured data documentation.

Added new documentation about Learning Video structured data.

May 2022

May 31: Removed the Job training structured data documentation. We initially tested this markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This change doesn't affect any other features that may use Job training markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.

May 22: Added transparency guidelines for video thumbnails. Ensure that at least 80% of your thumbnail pixels have little or no transparency to enable video indexing.

May 10:

Added new Education Q&A documentation.

Added new documentation about using valid page metadata.

Added new troubleshooting tip about headlines in the title link documentation.

May 6: Removed the deprecated tags and attributes from the Image and Video sitemaps documentation. For more information, refer to our announcement about the deprecation.

April 2022

April 14: Consolidated our How Search Works documentation for site owners by merging the basic, beginner, and advanced versions into one central document. While we cleaned up the language slightly, we haven't added anything new to the How Search Works documentation.

March 2022

March 23: Added two more best practices when writing high quality product reviews for reviews comparing multiple products.

March 17: Added a section to the SafeSearch documentation about allowing Google to fetch your video content files.

February 2022

February 25: Removed a reference to the Crawl Stats report in the signed exchange documentation. This is no longer relevant as of the update from November 4.

February 11: Added link to SXG Validator Chrome extension in the signed exchange documentation.

January 2022

January 28: Merged our SafeSearch documentation into one new document. We expanded on how SafeSearch works and added a troubleshooting section. The guidance remains the same: add the rating meta tag to explicit pages and group explicit content in a separate location on your site.

January 21: Added a new robots meta tag, indexifembedded, to the robots meta tag documentation. Learn more about the new tag in our blog post.

January 20: Added a note describing how to specify Car markup and still have Product review snippet feature eligibility.

January 18: Removed guidance about specifying a range for the cookTime, prepTime, and totalTime properties in the Recipe documentation. Currently, the only supported method is an exact time; time ranges aren't supported. If you're currently specifying a time range and you'd like Google to better understand your time values, we recommend updating that value in your structured data to a single value (for example, "cookTime": "PT30M").

December 2021

December 16: Converted our old blog post about intrusive interstitials into guidelines. There are no substantial changes compared to what we have in the blog post.

December 1: Added Write high quality product reviews to bring together advice from several blog posts.

November 2021

November 18: Explained how to opt out of Google Read Aloud and clarified the crawling behavior of the user agent.

November 17:

Added an interactive checklist that suggests readings based on the profile users select.

Added documentation about translated results and how to enable your ad network to work with translation-related Google Search features.

November 16: Added a guideline about logos and white backgrounds.

November 10:

Updated Logo documentation to support new flexibility in using the ImageObject type to specify an organization logo.

Published the list of Googlebot IP addresses.

November 4: Removed the recommendation to verify that SXGs are well-formed from the signed exchange documentation. Added a note that Google will automatically retry without an SXG Accept header in these cases.

November 4: Updated the page experience documentation to include the upcoming desktop rollout.

November 2: Added a recommendation about creating a dedicated page for each video to the Video best practices.

October 2021

October 28: Removed the following structured data fields from documentation, since they are unused by Google Search and Rich Result Test doesn't flag warnings for them:

HowTo: description.

QAPage: mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.author, mainEntity.dateCreated, mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.dateCreated, mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.author, mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.dateCreated, and mainEntity.author .

SpecialAnnouncement: provider, audience, serviceType, address, and category.

October 15: Added a requirement that the author.name field in Review snippets must be less than 100 characters to be eligible for use in Search features.

October 13: Clarified that VideoGame is not a valid node type for Software Apps. To make sure that your Software App is still eligible for a rich result appearance, co-type the VideoGame type with another supported type.

October 8: Updated our documentation about titles and snippets in Google Search results. There are now two separate documents that explain each of these search result features:

Control your title links in search results: Created a new page to describe how to control title links in search results. Introduced a new term, title link, for the title of a search result on Google Search and other properties to help clarify when we mean the title link in search results versus a <title> element on a web page. Added examples of how Google may adjust title links. There aren't any changes to the best practices for writing descriptive <title> elements.

Control your snippets in search results: Created a new page to describe how to control snippets in search results. The updates were minimal structural updates; there aren't any changes to the guidelines themselves.

September 2021

September 27: Added new documentation on Best practices for ecommerce sites in Google Search.

September 1: Added documentation about the beta Follow feature and your website.

August 2021

August 11: Added a new case study about how large images in Discover improve CTR and increase visits to publisher sites.

August 9: The Schema Markup Validator has stabilized, and Google now redirects the Structured Data Testing Tool to a landing page to help you select the right tool.

August 6: Added a new recommended author.url property to the Article structured data documentation. The url property helps Google disambiguate the correct author of the article.

July 2021 

July 30: Added technical, content, and quality guidelines to the Math solver guidelines and removed solution page markup instructions to make it easier for site owners to get their math solver site on Search. It is fine to remove any existing solution page markup.

July 29: Added a new case study about how MX Player boosted organic traffic 3x by maximizing video discoverability on Google.

July 28:

Removed guidance about hosting multiple factchecks per page. To be eligible for the single fact check rich result, a page must only have one ClaimReview element.

Added details about signed exchange cache lifetime.

July 26: Added a requirement that priceRange fields in Local business must be less than 100 characters to be eligible for use in Search features.

July 22:

Added example use cases for the FAQ guideline about hidden content on the page. The user must be able to access the answer on the page, and clicking an expandable section to view the answer is a valid use case.

Removed the @id property from the Local business documentation. The url property alone is a sufficient identifier to understand the local business.

July 21: Added a set of new documentation about Google search operators.

July 13: Added a new editorial guideline to the JobPosting documentation. Added a new optional property for directApply.

June 2021

June 29: Significantly expanded our redirects guide with the different kinds of redirects and their effects on Google Search.

June 25: Added a page that details how different HTTP status codes, and network and DNS errors affect crawling and indexing.

June 18: Based on feedback we've received from Search Central Product Experts and through the feedback tool, we've made several updates to our documentation:

Simplified the introduction page to make it clearer what is robots.txt and what is its intended use.

Expanded the instructions about creating and updating robots.txt files.

Removed redundant sections from our documentation about how Google handles robots.txt.

Simplified sentences across all robots.txt documentation in English. This helps with localization.

Removed redundant documentation about how to build, test, and release structured data. Each feature has guidance about this, embedded directly into each guide (for example, the Video structured data guide).

Improved the troubleshooting sections across all structured data feature guides (for example, the Product structured data guide).

Added more beginner-friendly information about how to get started with structured data.

June 15: Updated the timeline in the page experience documentation. The page experience update is now slowly rolling out to all users. It will be complete by the end of August 2021.

June 11:

Clarified the Sitelinks search box documentation to explain the more standard and explicit form for specifying the search box urlTemplate. Google will still accept the shorthand form as noted.

Added a new optional property to the Dataset documentation: funder.

June 10: Deprecated the critic review documentation. We initially tested critic review markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This deprecation doesn't affect any other features on Google Search that use review markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.

June 8: Added BackOrder as an allowed value for the availability property in Product structured data.

June 4: Added gtin as an allowed identifier and clarified how to correctly use isbn for Product structured data.

June 3: Added support for the inLanguage property to the Math solvers documentation.

June 1:

Modified the Math Solver developer documentation to add six new problem types.

Updated the DuplexWeb user agent (in Overview of Google crawlers) to use a more recent system and Chrome version.

May 2021

May 18:

Added documentation for SeekToAction structured data, which is an alternative way to participate in the key moments feature. Clip structured data is now out of beta, and available to be used by any site.

Modified the JobPosting region availability list to include Austria and Denmark.

May 6: Modified the publisher logo requirements of AMP Article structured data to more accurately reflect that we understand both raw URLs as well as ImageObject markup.

April 2021

April 19: Added new documentation for how to Get started with signed exchanges on Google Search. Learn more about the signed exchange (SXG) announcement in our blog post.

April 8: Added a new quality guideline to the Discover documentation. Discover focuses on interest-based feeds (for example, articles and videos), and filters out content that might confuse readers (for example, Discover might not recommend job applications, petitions, forms, code repositories, or satirical content that's removed from its original context).

April 7: Updated the Video structured data documentation to state that the thumbnailUrl property must use one of the supported Google Images file formats. Previously, the documentation didn't include WebP and SVG.

April 1: Clarified the key moments feature. Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively, there are two ways that you can manually tell Google which timestamp and label to use: Clip structured data and updating the description of a YouTube video.Currently, Google is working with a wide range of providers to ensure that the use of Clip structured data works well at scale (our interest form is closed, as we have reached capacity). You're welcome to read the documentation and implement Clip structured data in advance. Keep in mind that Google doesn't guarantee that your structured data will show up in search results, even if your page is marked up correctly according to the Rich Results Test.

March 2021 

March 29: Removed the interest form for the Key moments feature. The feature remains in development with a select group of providers, but the program is no longer accepting submissions.

March 25: Added new structured data documentation for practice problems and math solvers.

March 24:

Based on user feedback, we added examples for the property experienceRequirements.monthsOfExperience in the JobPosting structured data documentation.

Added a new optional property to the Dataset documentation: isAccessibleForFree.

March 17: Updated the video best practices to more clearly emphasize the important guidelines. Removed duplicate content and updated the screenshots.

March 16: Based on user feedback, we added more examples for the max-snippet meta robots directive, and also specified for each tag what Google's default behavior is when the tags are omitted.

March 11: Added new beta properties to the JobPosting structured data documentation. You may not see any appearance or effect in Google Search right away, as we are still developing how we are using this information.

educationRequirements.credentialCategory

experienceRequirements

experienceRequirements.monthsOfExperience

experienceInPlaceOfEducation

March 8: Added the JP_E-CODE value as an accepted value for the PropertyValue property in the Book documentation.

March 1: Removed instructions for submitting sitemaps on Google Sites from the sitemap guide. Google Sites doesn't create a sitemap for sites anymore.

February 2021 

February 8: Removed the page about joining the 3D and AR Early Adopters Program. The feature remains in development with a select group of providers, but the program is no longer accepting submissions.

February 2: Removed the documentation for cross-language search results. This page was specific to an experimental approach with a small group of providers, and we're removing the page because it's obsolete.

January 2021 

January 28: Updated the Event structured data documentation to state that the offers.priceCurrency property requires an ISO 4217 currency code.

January 22: Added documentation for the price drop enhancement for product rich results.

January 20: Updated the Job Training documentation to clarify that the appearance isn't available on Google Search right now.

January 5: Updated the list of recommended hreflang checker tools and removed those that don't work anymore.

December 2020

Large site owner's guide to managing your crawl budget

Web hosting services

Keep redacted information out of Google Search

Best practices for bloggers

Soft 404 errors

November 2020

Added information about Googlebot's ability to crawl through HTTP/2 to the Googlebot help page.

November 11: Published a redesign of the entire site. Reorganized the navigation to account for a migration of over 100 new pages from the Search Console Help Center. The notable additions include:

October 30:

Updated the librarySystem additionalProperty.value property in the Book documentation, replacing the national value with the government value.

Websites for political entities (such as campaigns, parties, or elected officials) aren't eligible for this feature.

You must clearly attribute the specific claim that you're assessing to a distinct origin (separate from your website), whether it's another website, public statement, social media, or other traceable source.

T-Mobile makes the right call 

integrating Google Pay 

What is T-Mobile?

Serving well over six million customers, T-Mobile is the #1 network 

operator in the Czech mobile communications market. The company 

is an integrated and convergent network operator that provides 

comprehensive ICT solutions for business customers and consumers 

in addition to its telecommunications services. Operating a high-

speed network, T-Mobile offers outstanding services and innovative 

technological solutions. 

Customers embrace a modern way to pay

T-Mobile has earned its place in the communications market by 

disrupting outdated industry practices and adopting a new way to 

provide wireless – focused on transparency, simplicity and putting 

customers first. So when Google Pay launched in March 2019, T-Mobile 

was quick to integrate this innovative tool to provide customers with 

an easy, safe, and modern payment method. The initiative resulted in 

7,525 new app users and a 20% increase in frequency of prepaid t

op up 

following the campaign.

A win-win for everyone

Google Pay delivers on a seamless payment journey that was quickly 

adopted by our customers leading to a 14% share of wallet (23% 

prepaid top ups, 13% bill payments). Additionally, to generate buzz and 

participation, T-Mobile gave customers who opted to use Google Pay the 

chance to win 1,000 CZK in prepaid credit, selecting 1,000 participants 

at random to win the coveted prize. 

“ 

Google Pay is a modern 

payment method that 

complements our strategy - 

becoming a digital leader in 

telco market. It delivers on a 

seamless payment journey 

that was quickly adopted by 

our customers. Google Pay 

gained a large share of wallet” 

Pavel Jareš

Head of Digital & Omnichannel

top up increased by 20% 

following the Google Pay 

integration.*

an increase of 7,525 new 

app users.*

August 10:

Added the gtin12 property to the Product structured data documentation. This has been supported; it's a documentation change only. Clarified that you can use the generic gtin property for all GTINs, but we recommend that you use the most specific one if possible.

Updated the dynamic rendering documentation to explain that this isn't a recommended solution, and is a workaround if you have no other choice. Instead we recommend server-side rendering, static rendering, or client-side rendering with hydration.

August 9: Added best practices for feeds to the Follow feature documentation. We recommend that you:

Use a descriptive title for your RSS feed, just like you would for a web page.

August 5: Added documentation about the pros and cons enhancement for editorial product review pages.

July 7: Added a new page for Google Search ranking updates. This is not new information; it's a compiled list of things we've previously confirmed on our blog or on Twitter.

July 6: Reorganized the navigational structure to be based on topic instead of level. Removed duplicate guides that were aimed at basic or beginner level, as these documents were duplicating guidance already explained in the SEO Starter Guide.

January 20: Added a note describing how to specify Car markup and still have Product review snippet feature eligibility.

If you're currently specifying a time range and you'd like Google to better understand your time values, we recommend updating that value in your structured data to a single value (for example, "cookTime": "PT30M").

December 2021

Control your title links in search results: Created a new page to describe how to control title links in search results. Introduced a new term, title link, for the title of a search result on Google Search and other properties to help clarify when we mean the title link in search results versus a <title> element on a web page. Added examples of how Google may adjust title links. There aren't any changes to the best practices for writing descriptive <title> elements.

Expanded the instructions about creating and updating robots.txt files.

Removed redundant sections from our documentation about how Google handles robots.txt.

Simplified sentences across all robots.txt documentation in English. This helps with localization.

Improved the troubleshooting sections across all structured data feature guides (for example, the Product structured data guide).

April 19: Added new documentation for how to Get started with signed exchanges on Google Search. Learn more about the signed exchange (SXG) announcement in our blog post.

April 8: Added a new quality guideline to the Discover documentation. Discover focuses on interest-based feeds (for example, articles and videos), and filters out content that might confuse readers (for example, Discover might not recommend job applications, petitions, forms, code repositories, or satirical content that's removed from its original context).

April 7: Updated the Video structured data documentation to state that the thumbnailUrl property must use one of the supported Google Images file formats. Previously, the documentation didn't include WebP and SVG.

April 1: Clarified the key moments feature. Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively, there are two ways that you can manually tell Google which timestamp and label to use: Clip structured data and updating the description of a YouTube video.Currently, Google is working with a wide range of providers to ensure that the use of Clip structured data works well at scale (our interest form is closed, as we have reached capacity). You're welcome to read the documentation and implement Clip structured data in advance. Keep in mind that Google doesn't guarantee that your structured data will show up in search results, even if your page is marked up correctly according to the Rich Results Test.

In the Estimated Salary documentation, replaced the unitText property with the duration property. Starting March 24, 2020, we updated the documentation to require duration instead of unitText. While we continue to support unitText, we require duration moving forward. We recommend that you switch over to using duration, if possible.

Updated the Google Podcasts brand assets to include localized Google Podcasts badges in 49 languages.

March 23: Added a new recommended field to the Package tracking developer documentation: CanReschedule.

March 20:

Added the Latest updates page (this page), which includes the major updates made to the Google Search developer documentation in March 2020.

Added a new recommendation to the JavaScript best practices about using long-lived caching to avoid caching issues with Googlebot. Added a new step about using content fingerprinting to the JavaScript troubleshooting documentation.

Added a note to the Event structured data documentation about the new optional properties that were added on March 16-17, 2020. The Rich Results Test now supports the new properties.

March 17:

Added optional properties to the Event structured data documentation: eventAttendanceMode, VirtualLocation type for location, location.url for online events. For more information about this change, check out our blog post.

Added general troubleshooting info to the Sitelinks search box documentation. Clarified that while Google Search may automatically display a search box scoped to your website, it's still helpful to explicitly provide information by adding WebSite structured data, which can help Google better understand your site.

In the Job training developer documentation, removed the hasCredential property from the list of recommended properties for EducationalOccupationalProgram. This is because hasCredential is only recommended for the Organization type on schema.org, not EducationalOccupationalProgram.

March 16: Added optional properties to the Event structured data documentation: eventStatus and previousStartDate. For more information about this change, check out our blog post.

March 5:

In the Product structured data documentation, clarified that one of the following properties is required: review, aggregateRating, offers. Changed the expected type for brand to be Brand or Organization (Thing is still accepted).

Added new recommended fields to the Package tracking developer documentation: TimestampEvent and LocationEvent.

March 3: Added hostload issues to the list of error messages in the mobile-first indexing best practices.

T-Mobile makes the right call 

integrating Google Pay 

What is T-Mobile?

Serving well over six million customers, T-Mobile is the #1 network 

operator in the Czech mobile communications market. The company 

is an integrated and convergent network operator that provides 

comprehensive ICT solutions for business customers and consumers 

in addition to its telecommunications services. Operating a high-

speed network, T-Mobile offers outstanding services and innovative 

technological solutions. 

Customers embrace a modern way to pay

T-Mobile has earned its place in the communications market by 

disrupting outdated industry practices and adopting a new way to 

provide wireless – focused on transparency, simplicity and putting 

customers first. So when Google Pay launched in March 2019, T-Mobile

an easy, safe, and modern payment method. The initiative resulted in

following the campaign.

A win-win for everyone

Google Pay delivers on a seamless payment journey that was quickly 

adopted by our customers leading to a 14% share of wallet (23% 

prepaid top ups, 13% bill payments). Additionally, to generate buzz and 

participation, T-Mobile gave customers who opted to use Google Pay the 

chance to win 1,000 CZK in prepaid credit, selecting 1,000 participants 

at random to win the coveted prize. 

“ 

Google Pay is a modern 

payment method that 

complements our strategy - 

becoming a digital leader in 

telco market. It delivers on a 

seamless payment journey 

that was quickly adopted by 

our customers. Google Pay

Direct

Key Point: The Direct integration allows merchants to decrypt the Google Pay response on their servers. To qualify, you must be Payments Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) Level 1 compliant. Your servers also need to have the required infrastructure to securely handle users' payment credentials.

Third parties that supply gateway or processing services on behalf of actual merchants aren't eligible to use the Direct integration. For questions about your integration as a payment service provider, contact us.

If you don't meet the necessary prerequisites, we recommend that you use a supported gateway to receive a payment token.

To decrypt a response directly on your servers, set type to DIRECT.

PropertyTypeNecessityDescriptionprotocolVersionstringRequiredThe version of the encryption/signature protocol expected in the response. Currently, ECv2 is supported. See Payment data cryptography for more information about available encryption and signature protocols.publicKeystringRequiredBase64-encoded elliptic curve public key. See the Encryption public key format section in our merchant cryptography documentation for more information.

Creating helpful, reliable, people-first content: This document consolidates advice from the helpful content blog post and the core updates post; none of the content is new.

October 12: Added support for image credits to the Image Metadata structured data documentation. Previously, you could only provide image credit information with IPTC photo metadata.

October 7: Added examples of product review pages to Write high quality product reviews.

September 2022

September 20: Added the Google Site Verifier user agent.

September 13:

Major update to Product structured data documentation to document requirements for eligibility to Merchant Listings experiences based on structured data. See the blog New Search Console Merchant Listings report: expanding eligibility with Product structured data for details.

Re-added the itemReviewed.datePublished property. This was removed accidentally as part of the previous update to the Fact Check structured data documentation.

September 9: Removed the datePublished property from the Fact Check structured data documentation. Currently, the ClaimReview publish date isn't used in the Fact Check rich result.

September 2: Migrated the documentation about the file types Google can index from the Search Console Help Center (the content hasn't changed).

September 1: Added more examples to show how meta descriptions could be improved.

August 2022

August 31: Added a note on the use of JavaScript to add, change, or remove meta tags on a page to the list of meta and inline tags Google Search understands.

August 29:

Added the full list of supported academic values for educationalLevel in the Learning video structured data documentation.

Clarified how to specify multiple types in Local Business structured data. If you have multiple types, specify them in an array (additionalType isn't supported).

August 24:

Added content guidelines to the Education Q&A structured data documentation.

Removed references to the deprecated International Targeting report in Search Console. The recommendations described in our documentation about managing multiregional sites and localized versions of your pages remain relevant.

August 22: Updated the Article structured data documentation to reflect that Article markup is open to all types of pages (as announced in 2020 with the page experience update).

August 11: Removed our documentation about rich-media files, such as Silverlight and Flash. Turns out it's not 2005 anymore.

August 10:

Added the gtin12 property to the Product structured data documentation. This has been supported; it's a documentation change only. Clarified that you can use the generic gtin property for all GTINs, but we recommend that you use the most specific one if possible.

Updated the dynamic rendering documentation to explain that this isn't a recommended solution, and is a workaround if you have no other choice. Instead we recommend server-side rendering, static rendering, or client-side rendering with hydration.

August 9: Added best practices for feeds to the Follow feature documentation. We recommend that you:

Use a descriptive title for your RSS feed, just like you would for a web page.

For multiple feeds, we recommend that you use a single feed. Both methods are still supported, but we clarified that a single feed is easier for you to maintain and for users to subscribe to your feed.

August 8: Clarified that we don't support the URL form for GTINs in Product structured data. Make sure to use the numerical GTIN form.

August 5: Added documentation about the pros and cons enhancement for editorial product review pages.

July 2022

July 19: Standardized how we refer to headings and title text on the page. Previously we used the word headline, but that can be confusing in other languages.

July 13: Updated the User Agent string for AdsBot Mobile Web. If you hardcoded the old value in your code, update the string to avoid potential bugs.

July 7: Added a new page for Google Search ranking updates. This is not new information; it's a compiled list of things we've previously confirmed on our blog or on Twitter.

July 6: Reorganized the navigational structure to be based on topic instead of level. Removed duplicate guides that were aimed at basic or beginner level, as these documents were duplicating guidance already explained in the SEO Starter Guide.

July 4: Clarified that you must add three courses to be eligible for the Course rich result. This is not a new requirement; it was previously only documented in the Carousel documentation.

June 2022

June 30: Added information about using JavaScript to inject canonical link tags.

June 23: Added information about how many bytes of textual content, such as HTML, Googlebot will crawl. For FAQs on the matter, check out our blog post.

June 17: Clarified that product rich results support pages that focus on a single product, and that includes product variants where each product variant has a distinct URL.

June 10: Documented new Vary: Cookie support for signed exchanges.

June 1:

Added new author markup best practices to the Article structured data documentation.

Added new documentation about Learning Video structured data.

May 2022

May 31: Removed the Job training structured data documentation. We initially tested this markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This change doesn't affect any other features that may use Job training markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.

May 22: Added transparency guidelines for video thumbnails. Ensure that at least 80% of your thumbnail pixels have little or no transparency to enable video indexing.

May 10:

Added new Education Q&A documentation.

Added new documentation about using valid page metadata.

Added new troubleshooting tip about headlines in the title link documentation.

April 2022

April 14: Consolidated our How Search Works documentation for site owners by merging the basic, beginner, and advanced versions into one central document. While we cleaned up the language slightly, we haven't added anything new to the How Search Works documentation.

March 2022

March 23: Added two more best practices when writing high quality product reviews for reviews comparing multiple products.

March 17: Added a section to the SafeSearch documentation about allowing Google to fetch your video content files.

February 11: Added link to SXG Validator Chrome extension in the signed exchange documentation.

January 2022

January 28: Merged our SafeSearch documentation into one new document. We expanded on how SafeSearch works and added a troubleshooting section. The guidance remains the same: add the rating meta tag to explicit pages and group explicit content in a separate location on your site.

January 21: Added a new robots meta tag, indexifembedded, to the robots meta tag documentation. Learn more about the new tag in our blog post.

January 20: Added a note describing how to specify Car markup and still have Product review snippet feature eligibility.

January 18: Removed guidance about specifying a range for the cookTime, prepTime, and totalTime properties in the Recipe documentation. Currently, the only supported method is an exact time; time ranges aren't supported. If you're currently specifying a time range and you'd like Google to better understand your time values, we recommend updating that value in your structured data to a single value (for example, "cookTime": "PT30M").

December 2021

December 16: Converted our old blog post about intrusive interstitials into guidelines. There are no substantial changes compared to what we have in the blog post.

November 4: Updated the page experience documentation to include the upcoming desktop rollout.

November 2: Added a recommendation about creating a dedicated page for each video to the Video best practices.

October 2021

October 28: Removed the following structured data fields from documentation, since they are unused by Google Search and Rich Result Test doesn't flag warnings for them:

HowTo: description.

QAPage: mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.author, mainEntity.dateCreated, mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.dateCreated, mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.author, mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.dateCreated, and mainEntity.author .

SpecialAnnouncement: provider, audience, serviceType, address, and category.

October 15: Added a requirement that the author.name field in Review snippets must be less than 100 characters to be eligible for use in Search features.

October 13: Clarified that VideoGame is not a valid node type for Software Apps. To make sure that your Software App is still eligible for a rich result appearance, co-type the VideoGame type with another supported type.

October 8: Updated our documentation about titles and snippets in Google Search results. There are now two separate documents that explain each of these search result features:

Control your title links in search results: Created a new page to describe how to control title links in search results. Introduced a new term, title link, for the title of a search result on Google Search and other properties to help clarify when we mean the title link in search results versus a <title> element on a web page. Added examples of how Google may adjust title links. There aren't any changes to the best practices for writing descriptive <title> elements.

Control your snippets in search results: Created a new page to describe how to control snippets in search results. The updates were minimal structural updates; there aren't any changes to the guidelines themselves.

September 1: Added documentation about the beta Follow feature and your website.

August 2021

August 11: Added a new case study about how large images in Discover improve CTR and increase visits to publisher sites.

August 9: The Schema Markup Validator has stabilized, and Google now redirects the Structured Data Testing Tool to a landing page to help you select the right tool.

August 6: Added a new recommended author.url property to the Article structured data documentation. The url property helps Google disambiguate the correct author of the article.

July 2021 

July 30: Added technical, content, and quality guidelines to the Math solver guidelines and removed solution page markup instructions to make it easier for site owners to get their math solver site on Search. It is fine to remove any existing solution page markup.

July 29: Added a new case study about how MX Player boosted organic traffic 3x by maximizing video discoverability on Google.

Added example use cases for the FAQ guideline about hidden content on the page. The user must be able to access the answer on the page, and clicking an expandable section to view the answer is a valid use case.

Removed the @id property from the Local business documentation. The url property alone is a sufficient identifier to understand the local business.

July 21: Added a set of new documentation about Google search operators.

July 13: Added a new editorial guideline to the JobPosting documentation. Added a new optional property for directApply.

June 2021

June 29: Significantly expanded our redirects guide with the different kinds of redirects and their effects on Google Search.

June 25: Added a page that details how different HTTP status codes, and network and DNS errors affect crawling and indexing.

June 18: Based on feedback we've received from Search Central Product Experts and through the feedback tool, we've made several updates to our documentation:

Simplified the introduction page to make it clearer what is robots.txt and what is its intended use.

Expanded the instructions about creating and updating robots.txt files.

Removed redundant sections from our documentation about how Google handles robots.txt.

Simplified sentences across all robots.txt documentation in English. This helps with localization.

Removed redundant documentation about how to build, test, and release structured data. Each feature has guidance about this, embedded directly into each guide (for example, the Video structured data guide).

Improved the troubleshooting sections across all structured data feature guides (for example, the Product structured data guide).

Added more beginner-friendly information about how to get started with structured data.

June 15: Updated the timeline in the page experience documentation. The page experience update is now slowly rolling out to all users. It will be complete by the end of August 2021.

June 11:

Clarified the Sitelinks search box documentation to explain the more standard and explicit form for specifying the search box urlTemplate. Google will still accept the shorthand form as noted.

Added a new optional property to the Dataset documentation: funder.

June 10: Deprecated the critic review documentation. We initially tested critic review markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This deprecation doesn't affect any other features on Google Search that use review markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.

June 4: Added gtin as an allowed identifier and clarified how to correctly use isbn for Product structured data.

April 2021

April 19: Added new documentation for how to Get started with signed exchanges on Google Search. Learn more about the signed exchange (SXG) announcement in our blog post.

April 8: Added a new quality guideline to the Discover documentation. Discover focuses on interest-based feeds (for example, articles and videos), and filters out content that might confuse readers (for example, Discover might not recommend job applications, petitions, forms, code repositories, or satirical content that's removed from its original context).

April 7: Updated the Video structured data documentation to state that the thumbnailUrl property must use one of the supported Google Images file formats. Previously, the documentation didn't include WebP and SVG.

April 1: Clarified the key moments feature. Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively, there are two ways that you can manually tell Google which timestamp and label to use: Clip structured data and updating the description of a YouTube video.Currently, Google is working with a wide range of providers to ensure that the use of Clip structured data works well at scale (our interest form is closed, as we have reached capacity). You're welcome to read the documentation and implement Clip structured data in advance. Keep in mind that Google doesn't guarantee that your structured data will show up in search results, even if your page is marked up correctly according to the Rich Results Test.

March 2021

March 11: Added new beta properties to the JobPosting structured data documentation. You may not see any appearance or effect in Google Search right away, as we are still developing how we are using this information.

educationRequirements.credentialCategory

experienceRequirements

experienceRequirements.monthsOfExperience

experienceInPlaceOfEducation

March 8: Added the JP_E-CODE value as an accepted value for the PropertyValue property in the Book documentation.

March 1: Removed instructions for submitting sitemaps on Google Sites from the sitemap guide. Google Sites doesn't create a sitemap for sites anymore.

February 8: Removed the page about joining the 3D and AR Early Adopters Program. The feature remains in development with a select group of providers, but the program is no longer accepting submissions.

chance to win 1,000 CZK in prepaid credit, selecting 1,000 participants 

at random to win the coveted prize.

Direct

Key Point: The Direct integration allows merchants to decrypt the Google Pay response on their servers. To qualify, you must be Payments Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) Level 1 compliant. Your servers also need to have the required infrastructure to securely handle users' payment credentials.

Third parties that supply gateway or processing services on behalf of actual merchants aren't eligible to use the Direct integration. For questions about your integration as a payment service provider, contact us.

If you don't meet the necessary prerequisites, we recommend that you use a supported gateway to receive a payment token.

To decrypt a response directly on your servers, set type to DIRECT.

PropertyTypeNecessityDescriptionprotocolVersionstringRequiredThe version of the encryption/signature protocol expected in the response. Currently, ECv2 is supported. See Payment data cryptography for more information about available encryption and signature protocols.publicKeystringRequiredBase64-encoded elliptic curve public key. See the Encryption public key format section in our merchant cryptography documentation for more information.

Example

In the following example, the publicKey value is abbreviated for readability.

"tokenizationSpecification": {
  "type": "DIRECT",
  "parameters": {
    "protocolVersion": "ECv2",
    "publicKey": "BOdoXP1aiNp.....kh3JUhiSZKHYF2Y="

Direct

Key Point: The Direct integration allows merchants to decrypt the Google Pay response on their servers. To qualify, you must be Payments Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) Level 1 compliant. Your servers also need to have the required infrastructure to securely handle users' payment credentials.

Third parties that supply gateway or processing services on behalf of actual merchants aren't eligible to use the Direct integration. For questions about your integration as a payment service provider, contact us.

If you don't meet the necessary prerequisites, we recommend that you use a supported gateway to receive a payment token.

To decrypt a response directly on your servers, set type to DIRECT.

PropertyTypeNecessityDescriptionprotocolVersionstringRequiredThe version of the encryption/signature protocol expected in the response. Currently, ECv2 is supported. See Payment data cryptography for more information about available encryption and signature protocols.publicKeystringRequiredBase64-encoded elliptic curve public key. See the Encryption public key format section in our merchant cryptography documentation for more information.

Example

In the following example, the publicKey value is abbreviated for readability.

"tokenizationSpecification": {
  "type": "DIRECT",
  "parameters": {
    "protocolVersion": "ECv2",
    "publicKey": "BOdoXP1aiNp.....kh3JUhiSZKHYF2Y="

T-Mobile makes the right call

integrating Google Pay

What is T-Mobile?

Serving well over six million customers, T-Mobile is the #1 network

operator in the Czech mobile communications market. The company

is an integrated and convergent network operator that provides

comprehensive ICT solutions for business customers and consumers

in addition to its telecommunications services. Operating a high-

speed network, T-Mobile offers outstanding services and innovative

technological solutions.

Customers embrace a modern way to pay

T-Mobile has earned its place in the communications market by

disrupting outdated industry practices and adopting a new way to

provide wireless – focused on transparency, simplicity and putting

customers first. So when Google Pay launched in March 2019, T-Mobile

was quick to integrate this innovative tool to provide customers with

an easy, safe, and modern payment method. The initiative resulted in

7,525 new app users and a 20% increase in frequency of prepaid t

op up

following the campaign.

A win-win for everyone

Google Pay delivers on a seamless payment journey that was quickly

adopted by our customers leading to a 14% share of wallet (23%

prepaid top ups, 13% bill payments). Additionally, to generate buzz and

participation, T-Mobile gave customers who opted to use Google Pay the

chance to win 1,000 CZK in prepaid credit, selecting 1,000 participants

at random to win the coveted prize.

“

Google Pay is a modern

payment method that

complements our strategy -

becoming a digital leader in

telco market. It delivers on a

seamless payment journey

that was quickly adopted by

our customers. Google Pay

gained a large share of wallet”

Pavel Jareš

Head of Digital & Omnichannel

following the Google Pay

integration.*

U.S. Treasury Check Security Features
Ultraviolet Overprinting Pattern
A protective ultraviolet pattern, invisible to the
naked eye, consisting of four lines of “FMS” or
"FISCALSERVICE” bracketed by the “Fiscal
Service” or “Financial Management Service”
seal on the left and United States Seal (eagle)
on the right. This pattern can usually be found
under the payee information and dollar amount
area. The FISCAL SERVICE pattern and seals
can be detected under a black light. If the
amount box is shaved or altered in any way, a
space will be created in the ultraviolet area.
When exposed to black light, the ink used in
the pattern and the seal will glow. This
fluorescent quality cannot be photocopied.
Treasury Seal
The seal identifies the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” or
"Financial Management Service." The previous seal
reflecting “Financial Management Service” will be seen
in rotation until this check stock runs out.
Bleeding Ink
The Treasury seal, located to the right of the Statue of
Liberty, contains security ink that will run and turn red
when moisture is applied to the black ink of the seal.
Microprinting
Microprinted words are so small they appear as just a
line to the naked eye. However, when magnified, they
become visible. Microprinting cannot be duplicated by a
copier and when a check is counterfeited, it will often
show up as a solid line or a series of dots. The U.S.
Treasury check has three areas where microprinting is
used.
Watermark
All U.S. Treasury checks are printed on
watermarked paper. The watermark
reads “U.S. TREASURY” and can be
seen from both the front and back of the
check when held up to a light. The
watermark is light and cannot be
reproduced by a copier. Any check not
having the watermark should be
suspected as being counterfeit or copied.
You may verify check issue information using the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Treasury Check Verification System (TCVS) at: https://tcvs.fiscal.treasury.gov

Use the QuickBooks debit card to get your cash

by QuickBooks•84•Updated May 19, 2022

Learn how to use your QuickBooks Checking debit card to withdraw money and make purchases.

After you sign up for QuickBooks Payments, if you're approved, you get a QuickBooks Checking account and a QuickBooks Checking debit card. It's a monthly fee-free checking account within QuickBooks where all of your customer payments get deposited.

Use your QuickBooks debit card to withdraw money from your QuickBooks Checking account. You can get cash from ATMs or make purchases like any other Visa debit card. And if you use your QuickBooks debit card for instant deposits, we also don't charge an additional fee for faster deposits. Here's how to set up and take money out using your QuickBooks debit card.

Step 1: Set up your QuickBooks Checking account

If you haven't already, sign up for QuickBooks Payments. If you're approved, you get a QuickBooks Checking account.

You'll get your physical QuickBooks debit card in the mail within 7 - 10 business days.

Step 2: Access and use your virtual debit card for purchases

Now find out where your virtual debit card is.

Go to Business overview then select Cash flow (Take me there), or go to Cash flow (Take me there).

Select QuickBooks Checking (Take me there).

Select Manage account.

In the QuickBooks Checking debit card section, select the option for Card info and complete the security step to verify your account. 

You'll now see your debit card number, expiration date, and CVV code.

Your virtual card is available until you activate your physical QuickBooks debit card.

Step 3: Activate and use your QuickBooks debit card

Activate your debit card when you get it in the mail.

Go to Business overview then select Cash flow (Take me there), or go to Cash flow (Take me there).

Select QuickBooks Checking (Take me there).

Using the shortcut menu, select Activate card.

Create a PIN you'll use to make withdrawals. Then select Next.

Enter the card number, expiration date, and CVV.

When you're done, select Confirm.

Your debit card is now active and ready to use.

Step 4: Use your QuickBooks debit card

Your QuickBooks debit card works like other debit cards. You can withdraw cash from any AllPoint ATM up to four times for free each month. After that, there's a $3.00 fee per withdrawal. You can also withdraw cash from other ATMs, but there may be a fee.

Here's how to locate an AllPoint ATM:

Sign in to your QuickBooks app from a mobile device.

Select Cash Flow from the menu.

Under the QuickBooks Checking balance, select View account,

Select Manage, then select Find ATM.

When the map opens, it'll use your location services to provide you with a list of nearby in-network ATMs.

You can also make purchases with your QuickBooks debit card where Visa debit cards are accepted.

Note: If you use instant deposits, there's no additional fee for using your QuickBooks Checking account. For other debit cards, the fee is 1%. This is in addition to the regular fees for processing transactions.

Step 5: Get account info or replace your card

Go to Business overview then select Cash flow (Take me there), or go to Cash flow (Take me there).

Select QuickBooks Checking (Take me there).

Select Manage.

Select View to see your account or routing number.

Select Replace card or Reset Pin to get help with your debit card.

Get help with specific transactions

If you need to dispute a transaction, call the number on the back of your QuickBooks debit card.

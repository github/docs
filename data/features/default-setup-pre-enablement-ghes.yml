# Default setup for code scanning can now be enabled on any repository, including repositories that don't contain a
# CodeQL-supported language, and scans will begin automatically if/when a CodeQL-supported language is added. This
# versioning pairs with `default-setup-pre-enablement` and was created to future-proof GHES-specific sections.
# Reference: #12363

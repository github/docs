    - "**HIGH:** A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed more permissions to be granted during a GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than was displayed to the user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and 2.22.13. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22866 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/)."
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Quotes included in Actions or Packages storage configuration could cause errors.
    - Custom pre-receive hooks could fail due to too restrictive file size or number of open file limits.
    - Orchestrator auto failover could be enabled during the phase of config apply.
    - Users with maintainer permissions to a repository were shown an e-mail verification warning instead of a successful page build on the repository Pages settings page.
    - The code owner of a wildcard rule would be incorrectly added to the list of owners for the code owners badge even if a later rule took precedence for that path.
    - OpenAPI documentation referred to an invalid header.
    - When creating or editing a pre-receive hook, a race condition in the user interface meant that after selecting a repository, files within the repository were sometimes not populated in files dropdown.
  changes:
    - Added logging for config change on HAProxy reload.
    - Added logging for repository creation.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.

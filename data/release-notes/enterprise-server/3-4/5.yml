  security_fixes:
    - "**MEDIUM**: Prevents an attack where an `org` query string parameter can be specified for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL that then gives access to another organization's active committers."
    - "**MEDIUM**: Ensures that `github.company.com` and `github-company.com` are not evaluated by internal services as identical hostnames, preventing a potential server-side security forgery (SSRF) attack."
    - "**LOW**: An attacker could access the Management Console with a path traversal attack via HTTP even if external firewall rules blocked HTTP access."
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Files inside an artifact archive were unable to be opened after decompression due to restrictive permissions.
    - Redis timeouts no longer halt database migrations while running `ghe-config-apply`.
    - Background job processors would get stuck in a partially shut-down state, resulting in certain kinds of background jobs (like code scanning) appearing stuck.
    - In some cases, site administrators were not automatically added as enterprise owners.
    - A rendering issue could affect the dropdown list for filtering secret scanning alerts in a repository.
  changes:
    - Improved the performance of Dependabot version updates after first enabled.
    - The GitHub Pages build and synchronization timeouts are now configurable in the Management Console.
    - Creating or updating check runs or check suites could return `500 Internal Server Error` if the value for certain fields, like the name, was too long.
    - When [deploying cache-server nodes](/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/configuring-a-repository-cache#configuring-a-repository-cache), it is now mandatory to describe the datacenter topology (using the `--datacenter` argument) for every node in the system. This requirement prevents situations where leaving datacenter membership set to "default" leads to workloads being inappropriately balanced across multiple datacenters.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]

      When using SAML encrypted assertions with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]
      
      To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.
      - Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
      - Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.

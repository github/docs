      **CRITICAL**: GitHub Enterprise Server's Elasticsearch container used a version of OpenJDK 8 that was vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. The vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2022-34169](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9339-86wc-4qgf).
    - |
      **HIGH**: Previously installed apps on user accounts were automatically granted permission to access an organization on scoped access tokens after the user account was transformed into an organization account. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
  bugs:
    - In some cases, GitHub Enterprise Server instances on AWS that used the `r4.4xlarge` instance type would fail to boot.
    - When calculating committers for GitHub Advanced Security, it was not possible to specify individual repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard#advanced-security-committers)." 
    - When a custom dormancy threshold was set for the instance, suspending all dormant users did not reliably respect the threshold. For more information about dormancy, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)."
  changes:
    - '`pre_receive_hook.rejected_push` events were not displayed in the enterprise audit log.'
    - Both migration archives for repositories and archive exports for user accounts include release reactions.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      After registering a self-hosted runner with the `--ephemeral` parameter on more than one level (for example, both enterprise and organization), the runner may get stuck in an idle state and require re-registration. [Updated: 2022-06-17]
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, releases may appear to be missing from repositories. This can occur when the required Elasticsearch index migrations have not successfully completed.

      GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]

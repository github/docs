    - The options to enable `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1` in the Privacy settings of the Management Console were shown, although removal of those protocol versions occurred in an earlier release.
    - In a HA environment, configuring MSSQL replication could require additional manual steps after enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for the first time.
    - A subset of internal configuration files are more reliably updated after a hotpatch. 
    - The `ghe-run-migrations` script would sometimes fail to generate temporary certificate names correctly.

    - LDAP user sync jobs would fail when trying to sync GPG keys that had been synced previously. 
    - Links to inaccessible pages were removed. 
    - Some instances experienced high CPU usage due to large amounts unnecessary background jobs being queued.

    - The "Site admin mode" link in the site footer did not change state when clicked. 
  changes:
    - Memcached connection limits were increased to better accommodate large cluster topologies. 
    - The Dependency Graph API previously ran with a statically defined port. 
    - The default shard counts for cluster-related Elasticsearch shard settings have been updated. 
    - The [Migrations API](/rest/reference/migrations) now generates exports of repositories. 
    - When filtering enterprise members by organization role on the "People" page, the text for the dropdown menu items has been improved.

    - Performance has been improved for web requests made by enterprise owners. 
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

      When using SAML encrypted assertions with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4.0 and 3.4.1, a new XML attribute `WantAssertionsEncrypted` in the `SPSSODescriptor` contains an invalid attribute for SAML metadata. IdPs that consume this SAML metadata endpoint may encounter errors when validating the SAML metadata XML schema. A fix will be available in the next patch release. [Updated: 2022-04-11]
      
      To work around this problem, you can take one of the two following actions.
      - Reconfigure the IdP by uploading a static copy of the SAML metadata without the `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute.
      - Copy the SAML metadata, remove `WantAssertionsEncrypted` attribute, host it on a web server, and reconfigure the IdP to point to that URL.

      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 was discontinued on February 16, 2022**. This means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/enterprise-management/upgrading-github-enterprise-server) as soon as possible.'

    - heading: Deprecation of XenServer Hypervisor support
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/docs-content/issues/4439
        - Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} on XenServer was deprecated and is no longer supported. Please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) with questions or concerns.

    - heading: Deprecation of the Content Attachments API preview
      notes:
        #
        - Due to low usage, we have deprecated the Content References API preview in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. The API was previously accessible with the `corsair-preview` header. Users can continue to navigate to external URLs without this API. Any registered usages of the Content References API will no longer receive a webhook notification for URLs from your registered domain(s) and we no longer return valid response codes for attempted updates to existing content attachments.

    - heading: Deprecation of the Codes of Conduct API preview
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1708
        - 'The Codes of Conduct API preview, which was accessible with the `scarlet-witch-preview` header, is deprecated and no longer accessible in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. We instead recommend using the "[Get community profile metrics](/rest/reference/repos#get-community-profile-metrics)" endpoint to retrieve information about a repository''s code of conduct. For more information, see the "[Deprecation Notice: Codes of Conduct API preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-06-deprecation-notice-codes-of-conduct-api-preview/)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog.'

    - heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API endpoints and API authentication using query parameters
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1316
        - |
          Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4, the [deprecated version of the OAuth Application API endpoints](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/#endpoints-affected) have been removed. If you encounter 404 error messages on these endpoints, convert your code to the versions of the OAuth Application API that do not have `access_tokens` in the URL. We've also disabled the use of API authentication using query parameters. We instead recommend using [API authentication in the request header](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/#changes-to-make).

    - heading: Deprecation of the CodeQL runner
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1632
        - The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner is deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 and is no longer supported. The deprecation only affects users who use {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} code scanning in third party CI/CD systems; {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} users are not affected. We strongly recommend that customers migrate to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} CLI, which is a feature-complete replacement for the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} runner. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-21-codeql-runner-deprecation/).

    - heading: Deprecation of custom bit-cache extensions
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1415
        - |
          Starting in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.1, support for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s proprietary bit-cache extensions began to be phased out. These extensions are deprecated in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 onwards.

          Any repositories that were already present and active on {% data variables.product.product_location %} running version 3.1 or 3.2 will have been automatically updated.

          Repositories which were not present and active before upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 may not perform optimally until a repository maintenance task is run and has successfully completed.

          To start a repository maintenance task manually, browse to `https://<hostname>/stafftools/repositories/<owner>/<repository>/network` for each affected repository and click the Schedule button.

  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.4.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'

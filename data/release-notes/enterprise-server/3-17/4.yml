  **Warning**: We have received a few reports of performance issues with GitHub Enterprise Server versions 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend holding off on upgrading to these versions until further notice. [Updated: 2025-08-01]

sections:
  security_fixes:
    - |
      The maintenance page in the Management Console did not include cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection.
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      When generating a support bundle, site administrators could encounter errors if character escaping caused the bundle script to omit the URL parameter for `curl`.
    - |
      Administrators would occasionally encounter timeouts when downloading diagnostics via the Management Console.
    - |
      In full cluster topologies, some expensive stats queries are skipped during `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` to prevent overloading the nodes with identical requests.
    - |
      Unsuccessful attempts to sign in to the Management Console were reported in the audit log and were indistinguishable from successful attempts.
    - |
      Taking a backup snapshot would sometimes fail because of a permissions error when the backup process attempted to create log files.
    - |
      Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) who were restricted from creating user namespace repositories could still create repositories in organizations and transfer them to their user namespace.
    - |
      SCIM provisioning requests failed when a user’s non-primary email was sent by the identity provider.
    - |
      SCIM managed enterprise users were able to edit email addresses.
    - |
      Administrators and users could experience delays due to performance regressions affecting the background processing of notification jobs.
  changes:
    - |
      For administrators performing a live upgrade, a new entry point has been added to the upgrade container to clean up database tables. This utility can be run manually via `ghe-live-migrations -cleanup`, and is also executed automatically via `ghe-config-apply` after a complete upgrade.
    - |
      During pre-upgrade operations of a live upgrade, tables are now renamed instead of being dropped immediately. The tables are then dropped at a later stage via `ghe-config-apply`.
    - |
      Events for adding or removing issues and pull requests from a project, or changing their status within a project, are now included in the items timeline alongside existing events. This update helps administrators and users more comprehensively track project-related activity.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      {% data reusables.release-notes.large-adoc-files-issue %}
    - |
      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.
    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      When initializing a new GHES cluster, nodes with the `consul-server` role should be added to the cluster before adding additional nodes. Adding all nodes simultaneously creates a race condition between nomad server registration and nomad client registration.
    - |
      Admins setting up cluster high availability (HA) may encounter a spokes error when running `ghe-cluster-repl-status` if a new organization and repositories are created before using the `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` command. To avoid this issue, complete the cluster HA setup with `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` before creating new organizations and repositories.
    - |
      In a cluster, the host running restore requires access the storage nodes via their private IPs.
    - |
      On an instance hosted on Azure, commenting on an issue via email meant the comment was not added to the issue.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      When publishing npm packages in a workflow after restoring from a backup to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.5.gm4 or 3.14.2.gm3, you may encounter a `401 Unauthorized` error from the GitHub Packages service. This can happen if the restore is from an N-1 or N-2 version and the workflow targets the npm endpoint on the backup instance. To avoid this issue, ensure the access token is valid and includes the correct scopes for publishing to GitHub Packages.
    - |
      Customers operating at high scale or near capacity may experience unexpected performance degradation, such as slow response times, background job queue spikes, elevated CPU usage, and increased MySQL load. Consider upgrading to {% ifversion ghes = 3.16 %}3.16{% endif %} {% ifversion ghes = 3.17 %}3.17{% endif %} with caution.
    - |
      The autolink references feature is missing from the repository settings page.
    - |
      When attempting to open a pull request as a draft in a private or internal repository, users are incorrectly prompted to upgrade their plan.[Updated: 2025-08-11]

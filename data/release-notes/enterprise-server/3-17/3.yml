      **HIGH**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed unauthorized read access to the contents of internal repositories for contractor accounts when the Contractors API feature was enabled. The Contractors API is a rarely-enabled feature in private preview. Following this fix, contractor account access to internal repositories via the API will be correctly blocked unless they have an alternate grant. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2025-6981](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-6981) for this vulnerability.
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      Applying a new GitHub Enterprise Server license using the Management Console would sometimes fail with a HTTP 500 error.
    - |
      Users saw outdated references to delegated bypass for push protection being in beta in the documentation for webhooks. Users may also have noticed unexpected behavior related to filtering newly approved push protection bypass requests on repository and organization request list pages.
  changes:
    - |
      Site administrators can now set `innodb_buffer_pool_size` in megabytes for MySQL using `ghe-config mysql.innodb-buffer-pool-size VALUE`.
    - |
      Site administrators running migrations on GitHub Enterprise Server benefit from optimized performance for code scanning, as garbage collection-related `ts_analyses` migrations are combined into a single step. This reduces migration time and minimizes operational disruption during upgrades.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.

      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      When initializing a new GHES cluster, nodes with the `consul-server` role should be added to the cluster before adding additional nodes. Adding all nodes simultaneously creates a race condition between nomad server registration and nomad client registration.
    - |
      Admins setting up cluster high availability (HA) may encounter a spokes error when running `ghe-cluster-repl-status` if a new organization and repositories are created before using the `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` command. To avoid this issue, complete the cluster HA setup with `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` before creating new organizations and repositories.
    - |
      In a cluster, the host running restore requires access the storage nodes via their private IPs.
    - |
      On an instance hosted on Azure, commenting on an issue via email meant the comment was not added to the issue.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      When publishing npm packages in a workflow after restoring from a backup to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13.5.gm4 or 3.14.2.gm3, you may encounter a `401 Unauthorized` error from the GitHub Packages service. This can happen if the restore is from an N-1 or N-2 version and the workflow targets the npm endpoint on the backup instance. To avoid this issue, ensure the access token is valid and includes the correct scopes for publishing to GitHub Packages.

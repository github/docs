    - '**MEDIUM**:  Secret Scanning API calls could return alerts for repositories outside the scope of the request.'
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Pages would become unavailable following a MySQL secret rotation until `nginx` was manually restarted.
    - Migrations could fail when {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} was enabled.
    - When setting the maintenance schedule with a ISO 8601 date, the actual scheduled time wouldn't match due to the timezone not being transformed to UTC.
    - Spurious error messages concerning the `cloud-config.service` would be output to the console.
    - The version number would not be correctly updated after a installing a hotpatch using `ghe-cluster-each`.
    - Webhook table cleanup jobs could run simultaneously, causing resource contention and increasing job run time.
    - When run from the primary, `ghe-repl-teardown` on a replica would not remove the replica from the MSSQL availability group.
    - The ability to limit email-based notifications to users with emails on a verified or approved domain did not work correctly.
    - When using CAS authentication and the "Reactivate suspended users" option was enabled, suspended users were not automatically reactivated.
    - A long-running database migration related to Security Alert settings could delay upgrade completion.
  changes:
    - The GitHub Connect data connection record now includes a count of the number of active and dormant users and the configured dormancy period.
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3 instances installed on Azure and provisioned with 32+ CPU cores would fail to launch, due to a bug present in the current Linux kernel. [Updated: 2022-04-08]'

      **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
  bugs:

      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: {% raw %}${{ inputs.strategies }}{% endraw %}`.
    - Download requests for Git LFS objects did not complete until reporting the final download size, which affected the latency of these requests, particularly on an instance with nodes functioning as repository caches.
    - On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
    - |
      When a site administrator ran `ghe-btop` via SSH, the command did not run and a `/usr/bin/env: python3: No such file or directory` error occurred.
    - Site administrators who prepared to enable GitHub Actions could not run the `ghe-actions-precheck` utility because the scripts file was not executable.
    - In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
    - On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com.
    - After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instance's list of organizations.

      After a site administrator exported a migration archive to AWS S3 using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the URL for the archive was inaccessible.
    - |
      If a site administrator exported a migration archive to a bucket in AWS S3s us-east-1 region using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the archive was inaccessible.
    - |
      Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages.
  changes:
    - If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
    - |
      After a site administrator exports a migration archive using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the link to the archive remains accessible for 48 hours instead of one hour.
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users who author custom patterns for secret scanning can provide expressions that must or must not match that are up to 2,000 characters. This limit is an increase from 1,000 characters.

      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license where secret scanning is enabled, excessive logging in `/var/log` may cause user-facing errors and degraded system performance if logs consume all free space on the volume. To prevent this issue from impacting users, monitor free space on your instance's root volume. For more information, see "[Configuring secret scanning for your appliance](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance)" and "[Monitoring your appliance](/admin/enterprise-management/monitoring-your-appliance)." If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance and you need help, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-05-03]

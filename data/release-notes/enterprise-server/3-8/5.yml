      **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).

      If a user's request to the instance's API included authentication credentials within a URL parameter, administrators could see the credentials in JSON within the instance's audit log. 
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - |
      If an administrator updated the instance's TLS certificate using the Management Console API's [Set settings](/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console) endpoint, sending the certificate and key data as a URL query parameter resulted in the data appearing unmasked in system logs.
    - Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow. 
    - After an enterprise owner set a permanent rate limit for a users GitHub App at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/installations`, the instance did not respect the rate limit. 
    - On an instance with multiple nodes, when using the `spokesctl` command-line utility to manage repositories with replicas that failed to fully create, the utility would spuriously attempt to repair healthy replicas. 
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and code scanning enabled, code scanning could not process some SARIF files produced by newer versions of CodeQL. 
    - On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI displayed an "Unable to render rich display" error and failed to render. 
  changes:
    - If a configuration runs fails due to Elasticsearch errors, `ghe-config-apply` displays a more actionable error message.

      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
    - |
      On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
    - |
      Organization owners cannot register a new SSH certificate authorities (CAs) due to an erroneous suggestion to start a trial. Organization SSH CAs configured before an upgrade to an affected version are still usable after the upgrade. Enterprise owners can can still register SSH CAs for all organizations.

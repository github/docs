          Projects, the flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub Enterprise Server, is now available as a beta. A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates issues and pull requests to help users plan and track work effectively. Users can create and customize multiple views, and each view can filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. Users can also define custom fields to track the unique metadata for a team or project, allowing customization for any needs or processes. This feature is subject to change. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)."

          Site administrators can improve the security of an instance by creating dedicated user accounts for the Management Console. Only the root site administrator can create user accounts. To control access for the user accounts, assign either the editor or operator role. Operators can manage administrative SSH access for the instance. For more information, see "[Managing access to the Management Console](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/managing-access-to-the-management-console)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2759
        - |
          To establish or comply with internal policies, site administrators can use the Management Console to configure an instance's policy for retention of data related to checks, including checks data generated by GitHub Actions and the Statuses API. Administrators can enable or disable retention, set a custom retention threshold, or set a custom hard-delete threshold.
          For more information, see "[Configuring applications](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-applications)" [Updated: 2023-03-02]

          Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can analyze two additional languages for vulnerabilities and errors using CodeQL code scanning. Support for Ruby is generally available, and support for Kotlin is in beta and subject to change.

          - Ruby analysis can detect more than twice the number of common weaknesses (CWEs) it could detect during beta. A total of 30 rules can identify a range of vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS), regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS), SQL injection, and more. Additional library and framework coverage for Ruby-on-Rails ensures that web service developers get even more precise results. GitHub Enterprise Server supports all common Ruby versions, up to and including 3.1.
          - Kotlin support is an extension of existing Java support, and benefits from the [existing CodeQL queries for Java](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/), which apply to both mobile and server-side applications. GitHub has also improved and added a range of mobile-specific queries, covering issues such as handling of Intents, Webview validation problems, fragment injection, and more.

          For more information about code scanning, see "[About code scanning with CodeQL](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql)."

          During configuration of storage for GitHub Actions, site administrators can avoid risks associated with the input of sensitive secrets and access keys by using OIDC to connect to object storage providers. GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server supports OIDC for connections to AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Enabling GitHub Actions for GitHub Enterprise Server](/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2618
        - |
          To prevent untrusted logging of data from the `set-state` and `set-output` workflow commands, action authors can use environment files for the management of state and output.

          - To use this feature, the runner application must be version 2.297.0 or later. Versions 2.298.2 and later will warn users who use the `save-state` or `set-output` commands. These commands will be fully disabled in a future release.
          - To use the updated `saveState` and `setOutput` functions, workflows using the GitHub Actions Toolkit must call `@actions/core` v1.10.0 or later.

          For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#environment-files)."

          Users can prevent a job from running on a runner outside the intended group by defining the names of the intended runner groups for a workflow within the `runs-on` key.

          ```yaml
          runs-on:
            group: my-group
            labels: [ self-hosted, label-1 ]
          ```

          Additionally, GitHub Enterprise Server will no longer allow the creation of runner groups with identical names at the organization and enterprise level. A warning banner will appear for any runner groups within an organization that share a name with a runner group for the enterprise.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2693

          Users can save time and switch context less often by receiving and acting on real-time updates about GitHub Enterprise Server activity directly within Slack or Microsoft Teams. GitHub's integrations for these services are now generally available. For more information, see "[GitHub extensions and integrations](/get-started/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/github-extensions-and-integrations)."

      When a site administrator runs a command using administrative SSH access, the command is now logged. To help GitHub Support troubleshoot and debug, support bundles include a log containing these commands.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2538
    - |
      To simplify the discovery of events within enterprise, organization, or user audit logs, the search bar now displays a list of available filters.

      Before a site administrator can migrate away from GitHub Enterprise Server using the [GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI](https://github.com/github/gh-gei), the [startRepositoryMigration](/graphql/reference/mutations#startrepositorymigration) GraphQL API, or the [Start an organization migration](/rest/migrations/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#start-an-organization-migration) REST API, the administrator must use the Management Console to configure a blob storage provider for the storage of migration archives. Supported provides include Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Previously, blob storage was not required and could optionally be configured using `gh gei`. This change adds support for migrations where the Git source or metadata is larger than 1 GB.

      To help users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license better understand detected secrets and take action, secret scanning alerts concerning third-party API keys now include a link to the provider's documentation. For more information, see "[About secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2386
    - |
      Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license will now see the actions that users took on a secret scanning alert directly within the alert's timeline, including when a contributor bypassed push protection for a secret.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2387
    - |
      Instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license will regularly run a historical scan to detect newly added secret types on repositories with GitHub Advanced Security and secret scanning enabled. Previously, users needed to manually run a historical scan.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2640
    - |
      On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to ensure that future releases of GitHub Enterprise Server can always display a preview of a detected secret in the APIs or web UI, the detected secrets are now stored separately from source code. Detected secrets are stored using symmetric encryption. [Updated: 2023-02-15]

      When using private registries for Dependabot updates, GitHub Enterprise Server behaves more securely. If a private registry is configured for any of the following ecosystems, the instance will no longer make any package requests to public registries.

      - Bundler
      - Docker
      - Gradle
      - Maven
      - npm
      - Nuget
      - Python
      - Yarn

      For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2750
    - |
      Elixir developers who use [self-hosted Hex repositories](https://hex.pm/docs/self_hosting) can configure a private registry for Dependabot version updates on GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries)."

      Dependabot alerts features the following usability improvements.

      - The page for an alert refreshes automatically after Dependabot attempts to create a pull request for an update.
      - Alerts are more accurately mapped to pull requests from Dependabot updates.
      - To improve the alert for the community, users can suggest improvements to alerts directly in the GitHub Advisory Database.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2744
    - |
      Users can more easily mention **@dependabot**. When mentioning users, the Dependabot user account now appears as an autocomplete suggestion.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2631
    - |
      In repositories with vulnerable dependencies, Dependabot will no longer display a yellow banner. To notify contributors of vulnerable dependencies, the **Security** tab displays an alert counter.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2602
    - |
      If a user forks a repository with an existing Dependabot configuration in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot updates will be disabled in the fork by default. To enable updates in the fork, the user must visit the repository's code security and analysis settings. For more information, see "[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2621
    - |
      Integrators who wish to receive a webhook for Dependabot alerts must use the new `dependabot_alert` webhook. This webhook replaces the `repository_vulnerability_alert` webhook. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#dependabot_alert)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2704
    - |
      To improve readability of GitHub Actions workflows that reference other actions by commit SHA, action authors often write a comment including the corresponding semantic version on the line that calls the action. To save time, pull requests for Dependabot version updates will now automatically update the semantic version in these comments.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2294
    - |
      JavaScript developers who use Node.js, npm, and Dependabot security updates can save time when updating npm projects with transitive dependencies.

      - Dependabot can update both parent and child dependencies together. Previously, Dependabot would not update transitive dependencies when the parent required an incompatible specific version range, requiring manual upgrades.
      - Dependabot can create pull requests that resolve alerts where an update to a direct dependency would remove the vulnerable transitive dependency from the tree.

      For more information, see "[About Dependabot security updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2700
    - |
      For people who use Dependabot for version updates in the Docker ecosystem, Dependabot will proactively update Docker image tags in Kubernetes manifests. For more information, see "[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#package-ecosystem)."

      A number of improvements are available to users who contribute to security advisories on GitHub.com, including the following changes.

      - To ensure faster review, GitHub prompts users to add a reason for the change.
      - To ensure that the contribution matches the user's intent, GitHub will not reorder reference links in the diff.

      GitHub Actions features the following discoverability and accessibility improvements.

      - The navigation experience for searching workflows and workflow runs is improved.
      - Added structure better represents the hierarchy between caller and called reusable workflows.
      - The mobile browsing experience is more consistent, and supports multiple viewport sizes.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2524
    - |
      GitHub Actions workflows will no longer trigger endlessly when using `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` events. Prior to this change, events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not create a new workflow run. For more information, see "[Triggering a workflow](/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2543
    - |
      For scheduled runs of GitHub Actions workflows, users will see additional information about the repository, organization, and enterprise within the payload for `github.event`.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2727
    - |
      Users of GitHub Actions have better insight into the progress of a job when using environment protection rules. The `workflow_job` webhook supports a new `waiting` state whenever a job is awaiting an environment protection rule. Also, when a job refers to an `environment` key in its YAML definition, the `workflow_job` webhook payload will also include a new property, `deployment`. `deployment` contains metadata about the deployment that the check run created. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

      Organization owners can find more meaningful context within audit log events.

      - `business.sso_response` and `org.sso_response` events appear in the REST API and payloads for audit log streaming.
      - `repo.rename`, `project.rename`, and `protected_branch.update_name` events include the current and past names for these renamed within the `old_name` field.
      - Events for Dependabot alerts contain `alert_number`, `ghsa_id`, `dismiss_reason`, and `dismiss_comment` fields, in addition to a link back to the alert and an accurate timestamp.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2537

      The banner displayed atop an archived repository in the web UI now includes the repository's archival date.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2286
    - |
      The **Conversations** and **Files** tabs in pull requests now load more quickly due to deferred syntax highlighting.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2561
    - |
      To provide a more consistent experience between the web UI and users' workstations, and to speed up the process of checking whether users can merge a pull request automatically, GitHub Enterprise Server now uses the `merge-ort` strategy. For more information, see [Merge strategies](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-ort) in the Git documentation.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2496
    - |
      To improve the display of the initial comment in pull requests that contain one commit, GitHub Enterprise Server now automatically reformats detailed commit messages to adhere to GitHub's Markdown conventions.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2511
    - |
      When squash-merging a pull request, the author of the Git commit is displayed before merging. Previously, the commit author was only displayed when merging with a merge commit.

      During configuration of high availability, after you run `ghe-maintenance -s` in step 12 of [this documentation](/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/creating-a-high-availability-replica#creating-a-high-availability-replica), the following error appears and maintenance mode is not enabled.

      ```
      unable to access '/data/user/common/cluster.conf': Permission denied
      ```

      You can ignore the error and proceed to the next step. The issue will be resolved in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.1. [Updated: 2023-03-06]
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

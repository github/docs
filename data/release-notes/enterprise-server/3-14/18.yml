    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      When generating a support bundle, site administrators could encounter errors if character escaping caused the bundle script to omit the URL parameter for `curl`.
    - |
      In some environments, `syslog-ng` could write excessive logs to a regular file named `tty10`, continuously filling disk space.
    - |
      Secret scanning backfills for pull requests and discussions did not run as expected during backfills of new secret types. Site administrators and security teams may have noticed incomplete secret scanning coverage or unworked queues after upgrading.
    - |
      Administrators saw daily `SignalException` errors in `github-stream-processors` when log rotation happened. Log rotation using "copytruncate" no longer sends SIGUSR1, preventing these errors and improving log management stability. No administrator action is required.
    - |
      Maintenance periods scheduled more than a week in advance were triggered on the first occurrence of the scheduled day-of-week rather than the intended specific date.
  changes:
    - |
      For administrators managing logs, log folders are more consistently accessible from the administrative account without the need to use `sudo`.
    - |
      Azure VMs that use the NVMe disk controller are now supported, as well as Azure VMs that do not include temporary resource disks.
  known_issues:
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      Unexpected elements may appear in the UI on the repo overview page for locked repositories.

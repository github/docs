      **MEDIUM:** An attacker could steal sensitive information by exploiting a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the repository transfer feature. This exploitation would require social engineering. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-8770](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-8770) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
  bugs:
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
    - |
      `ghe-storage-find` was sometimes unable to identify a data disk.
    - |
      After upgrading the relevant GHES version, the `resolvconf` service failed to start due to a missing directory.
    - |
      Some pre-receive hooks using the `faccessat2` system call, such as those using Alpine Linux as the base, failed unexpectedly.
    - |
      When configuring a high availability replica and during the database seeding of a MySQL replica node, restarting the nomad service could time out. Consequently, when MySQL replication attempted to start an error was reported, and setting up replication failed.
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-status` command returned an error if a soft-deleted repository had a checksum mismatch.
    - |
      Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
    - |
      Some repositories could miss spokes information after restoring in a clustering topology due to unrescued exceptions.
    - |
      In organizations with a large number of repositories, when an administrator used repository properties to target repositories in an organization ruleset, the ruleset index page timed out.
    - |
      After a user created a Projects Insights chart with time as the X-axis, the chart became hidden and inaccessible.
    - |
      Fixes a known issue where some links to GitHub Docs from GitHub Enterprise Server may lead to a “Page not found.” Previously, the links incorrectly added `enterprise-cloud@latest` to the URL.
    - |
      A bug introduced in 3.12 which prevented the search input in the global navigation from displaying a dropdown of search suggestions has been fixed. The search input functionality prior to 3.12 has been restored, and users are once again able to see and submit suggested search queries, including scope suggestions.
    - |
      Custom links to other repositories displayed incorrect breadcrumbs.
    - |
      The Secret Scanning Push Protection custom resource link set at the Enterprise level was not being displayed to users being blocked when pushing secrets to a repository using git through the command line interface.
    - |
      Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-09-27]
  changes:
    - |
      For instances deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), site administrators can configure regional AWS STS endpoints for OIDC from the Management Console.
    - |
      Site administrators can now configure the instance with NUMA optimizations.
  known_issues:
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as `127.0.0.1`.

    - |
      Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
    - |
      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance onto a 3.13 appliance, the elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.

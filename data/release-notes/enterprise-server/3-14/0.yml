sections:

  features:
    - heading: Instance administration
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4262
        - |
          On an instance with multiple replica nodes, to start or stop replication for all nodes in a single configuration run, administrators can use the `ghe-repl-start-all` and `ghe-repl-stop-all` commands.

    - heading: Instance services
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4178
        - |
          Administrators can scale the appliance using generation 2 virtual machines, with support for booting in UEFI mode. This requires deploying a new instance and restoring data onto it. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/using-generation-2-virtual-machines)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4179
        - |
          Nomad has been upgraded to 1.5.17 and Consul has been upgraded to 1.17.4. These services are used in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} to orchestrate containers and configuration.

    - heading: Identity and access management
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4087
        - |
          Automated user provisioning via the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard is available in public beta. Instances that use SAML authentication can enable SCIM to provision user accounts and manage their lifecycle from an identity provider (IdP). You can configure SCIM using an application for supported IdPs, or using the REST API endpoints for SCIM. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/user-provisioning-with-scim-on-ghes)."

          * If your instance already uses SAML, you will need to configure a new IdP application that supports automated provisioning via SCIM.
          * Existing private beta customers should also reconfigure their implementation with an updated application.
          * During the public beta, we recommend testing SCIM support for your identity system in a non-production instance before adding SCIM to your current setup.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3905
        - |
          Organization owners can create and assign custom organization roles, delegating administrative duties to trusted teams and users. See "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-organization-roles)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4026
        - |
          Users can use the account switcher to switch between multiple accounts. See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/switching-between-accounts)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4025
        - |
          On an instance that uses built-in authentication, users can use passkeys to sign in securely to GitHub, without needing to input their password. See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3789
        - |
          Enterprises that use an SSH certificate authority can allow SSH certificates to be used to access user-owned repositories. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#managing-access-to-user-owned-repositories)."

    - heading: Audit logs
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3793
       - |
         Every 24 hours, a health check runs for each audit log stream. If a stream is set up incorrectly, an email will be sent to the enterprise owners as notification that their audit log stream is not properly configured.

    - heading: Secret scanning
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3179
        - |
          Users can specify which teams or roles have the ability to bypass push protection. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations#enabling-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3567
        - |
          Secret scanning detects secrets leaked in discussions and in pull request titles, bodies, and comments. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3740
        - |
          Secret scanning blocks contributors from uploading files with detected secrets if push protection is enabled for a repository. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3741
        - |
          Audit log events are created when secret scanning non-provider patterns are enabled or disabled at the repository, organization, or enterprise level.

    - heading: Code scanning
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3707
        - |
          Users can create a dedicated code scanning rule to block pull request merges, instead of relying on status checks. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/set-code-scanning-merge-protection)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3734

See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#including-local-sources-of-tainted-data-in-default-setup)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3936
        - |
          Organizations that use default setup for code scanning can use organization-level model packs to extend the coverage of multiple repositories. This feature is in public beta and subject to change. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3663
        - |
          CodeQL can scan Java projects without a build. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3865
        - |
          This release comes installed with version **2.17.6** of the CodeQL CLI, used in the CodeQL action for code scanning. Significant updates since the default version installed on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13 include:

          * Support for Java 22, Swift 5.10, TS 5.4, and C# 12
          * New queries for C/C++, Go, Java, and Ruby:
            * `cpp/type-confusion`:	Detects casts to invalid types
            * `cpp/iterator-to-expired-container`:	Detects the creation of iterators owned by temporary objects that are about to be destroyed
            * `go/uncontrolled-allocation-size`: Detects slice memory allocation with excessive size value

            * `rb/csrf-protection-not-enabled`:	Detects cases where Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is not enabled in Ruby on Rails controllers

    - heading: Dependabot
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3344
        - |
          Users can consolidate Dependabot pull requests by enabling grouped security updates for related dependencies in a package ecosystem. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-grouped-security-updates)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3839
        - |
          Dependabot can access Cargo private registries to provide updates to Rust dependencies. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/guidance-for-the-configuration-of-private-registries-for-dependabot#about-configuring-private-registries-for-dependabot)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3848
        - |
          Dependabot pauses scheduled jobs after 15 failures. This gives an earlier indication of potential issues while still ensuring that critical security updates continue to be applied without interruption.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3850
        - |
          Dependabot uses private registry configurations specified in the `dependabot.yml` file as expected, even if there is a configuration with `target-branch`. This ensures that security updates are applied correctly, regardless of your repository's configuration settings. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot)."

    - heading: Code security

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/4212
        - |
          The security overview dashboard for organizations is now generally available.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3913
        - |
          On the security overview dashboard, users can view alert trends grouped by tool. The group-by option is designed to improve the ability to track and analyze the effectiveness of scanning tools, enabling more strategic decision-making. See "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights#viewing-the-security-overview-dashboard-for-your-organization)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3912
        - |
          On the security overview dashboard, users can filter by security tool. This feature is in public beta and subject to change.

      Pushes that update over 5,000 branches no longer trigger webhooks or GitHub Actions workflows.

  known_issues:
    - |
      Complete SCIM payloads are written to the audit log, including SCIM attributes that are not required or supported per [API docs](/rest/enterprise-admin/scim?apiVersion=2022-11-28#supported-scim-user-attributes). Customers using Okta with SCIM may notice that a placeholder password attribute is among the data passed to audit logs in its current configuration. This placeholder data is associated with Okta’s password synchronization feature that is not expected or required by GitHub. See [okta-scim](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-scim/guides/scim-20/#create-the-user) for more information.

      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shut down the node and repeat the steps.
    - |
      If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 appliance, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up. This happens via a nightly scheduled job. It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      The global search bar does not have suggestions enabled due to the redesigned navigation and pending new search experience.

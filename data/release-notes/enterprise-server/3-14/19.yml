      **CRITICAL:** Redis has been upgraded to version 6.2.20 to address CVE-2025-49844 (also known as RediShell). Administrators should apply this update promptly to mitigate potential security risks.
    - |
      **HIGH:** A privilege escalation vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an authenticated enterprise admin to gain root SSH access. The exploit used a symlink escape in pre-receive hook environments. An attacker could craft a malicious repository and environment to replace system binaries during hook cleanup. This allowed them to execute a payload that added their SSH key to the root user's authorized keys, granting root SSH access. The attacker needed enterprise admin privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This has been assigned CVE-2025-11578 and was reported through the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
    - |
      **HIGH:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers by supplying a malicious `label:` value that was injected into the DOM without proper sanitization. This could be triggered when a user visits a crafted Issues search URL, enabling session hijacking, account takeover, and recovery code exfiltration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2025-11892](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-11892) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      Users applying a new license file received an HTTP 500 error.
    - |
      SVG files stored in Git Large File Storage (LFS) failed to render on the web interface.
    - |
      On the "Scheduled workflows" page in the site admin dashboard, actors attributed to workflows appeared as "Not found".
  changes:
    - |
      Elasticsearch deprecation warnings, which are logged to index files in new versions of Elasticsearch, have been disabled. These warnings provided no value to administrators, and in some cases could block upgrades of instances in high-availability or cluster configurations.
  known_issues:
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.

      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shut down the node and repeat the steps.

      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  You can also trigger the reindexing by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      Unexpected elements may appear in the UI on the repository overview page for locked repositories.

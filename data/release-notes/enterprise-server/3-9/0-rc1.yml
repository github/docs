  changes: 
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2909
    - |
      Field names for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed as part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Additional field names will change in upcoming releases. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

      - `level` is now `SeverityText`.
      - `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
      - `now` is now `Timestamp`.
      - Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
      - Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job.

      For a full list of mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv).

    # https://github.com/github/ghes/issues/6342
    - |
      On a configured instance, the name for the HAProxy service is now `haproxy-frontend`. Previously, the name was `haproxy`. Additionally, on an unconfigured instance, there is a new service named `haproxy-pre-config`. If your instance forwards logs to an external system, update your rules to reflect these changes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity/log-forwarding)" article

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2757

      For an instance or organization with 2FA enabled, when a user sets up 2FA, GitHub Enterprise Server suggests an authenticator app (TOTP) by default.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3160
    - |
      When a person with administrative SSH access to an instance submits a support bundle using either the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utility, a period for log collection specified with the `-p` or `--period` no longer requires quotes to enclose the date value. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-support-bundle)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2745
    - |
      To provide additional context within the web interface on an instance where Dependabot alerts are enabled, links to Dependabot alerts in an issue or pull request comment display an improved label and hovercard with alert details.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2599
    - |
      On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, people with write or maintain access to a repository can view or act on Dependabot alerts by default. Custom roles, the security manager role, organization permissions, and notification settings are not affected.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2946
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and GitHub Connect enabled for the synchronization of actions from GitHub.com, CodeQL code scanning is up to 16% faster. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2865
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and email configured for notifications, users can receive notifications for secret scanning alerts by watching a repository and choosing "All activity" or "Security alerts". To continue receiving notifications for secret scanning alerts in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later, users must enable email notifications in the web interface at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/settings/notifications` under "Watching" by choosing "Email".

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2724

      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning alerts display whether detected tokens from GitHub are valid.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2776
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the enterprise and organization audit logs now display an event when an owner enables or disables a push protection for a custom pattern for a repository, organization, or the enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#org-category-actions)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning_push_protection-category-actions)."

      Users can filter the lists of alerts for Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning by repository topic or team in the security overview for an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/filtering-alerts-in-security-overview)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3073
    - |
      In the security overview for an organization, the following improvements apply to the "Security coverage" view during feature enablement.

      - To provide insight into the number of GitHub Advanced Security licenses used, active committers for the repository are visible. For repositories where GitHub Advanced Security is not enabled, the number indicates the number of licenses required to enable the feature.
      - Unsaved changes are now labeled with a "Modified" tag, and the "Save security settings" button now displays the total number of changes to save.
      - While a security feature is being enabled, the "Security coverage" view shows a status of "Updating..." to inform you of the ongoing process.
      
      For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2811
    - |
      In the security overview's "Security risk" and "Security coverage" views, when a user selects a team from the "Team" drop-down or filters by team, results appear for repositories where the team has write or administrative access or has been granted access to security alerts. Previously, users could only view results for repositories where the team had administrative access or had been granted access to security alerts.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2822
    - |
      To provide more context within a project, users can share a deep link to a specific issue in a project to have the issue open in the project's side panel.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2958
    - |
      Organization owners can create up to five custom repository roles. Previously, the limit was three. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2799

      When transferring a repository, users can also rename the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2961
    - |
      If a user archives a repository, responses from the GraphQL API that include information about the repository now include an `archivedAt` value with a timestamp representing the archival date.

  backups:
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3050
    - |
     Before beginning a backup with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 and later, the `ghe-host-check` utility will now perform a preflight check on the backup host to confirm the software version and disk space requirements. For more information, see the [3.9.0 release](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/releases/tag/v3.9.0) in the github/backup-utils repository on GitHub.com.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3052
    - |
     GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 allows administrators to view the progress of backup and restoration operations on the backup host using the `ghe-backup-progress` utility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance#monitoring-backup-or-restoration-progress)."

  known_issues:
    - |
      If you upgrade from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9, the database server on your instance will be upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. I/O utilization will increase as a result, and in some cases this may affect your instance's performance. Do not upgrade to this RC in a production environment, and ensure that you take and verify a backup of the instance before upgrading to the GA release. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."

      {% data reusables.release-notes.manage-api-unreachable %}
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

      ```
      Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID
      ```

      You can safely ignore this message.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
    - |
      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`. 
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

  deprecations:
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2826
    - heading: Change to command-line utility for management of replication
      notes:
        - |
          On an instance with multiple nodes, people with administrative SSH access to the instance should use `ghe-spokesctl` for management of Git replication instead of `ghe-spokes`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-spokesctl)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2773
    - heading: Dependency graph no longer ingests go.sum files
      notes:
        - |
          Because `go.sum` files are not lock files and may result in false positive Dependabot alerts, on an instance with the dependency graph enabled, the `go.sum` files are no longer ingested for users' Go repositories. If Dependabot alerts are enabled, Dependabot will no longer alert users for vulnerabilities in a `go.sum` file's dependencies. The dependency graph continues to support `go.mod` files, the recommended format for Go projects. Use Go 1.17 or higher to ensure your `go.mod` file contains a comprehensive view of all direct and transitive dependencies. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2938
    - heading: Only GitHub Actions can publish a GitHub Pages site if source includes symbolic links
      notes:
        - |
          To improve the security of an instance where users deploy sites using GitHub Pages, sites that contain symbolic links will no longer build outside of GitHub Actions. If a user's site is affected and a site administrator has configured email for the instance, the user will receive an email with instructions about how to fix the error. To continue using symbolic links in the site's source, the instance must be configured for GitHub Actions, and the user must write a GitHub Actions workflow to use as a publishing source. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)."

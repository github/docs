  {% warning %}

  **Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.2-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

  The known issues originally published on 2023-07-28 omitted a number of known issues that still existed. The `Known issues` section below was updated on 2023-08-08.
  {% endwarning %}
sections:
  changes:
    - |
      Added a pre-upgrade check to validate the GHES version and MySQL configuration before allowing an upgrade to 3.9.
    - |
      Adjusted the timeout threshold for shutting down MySQL to prevent premature termination when upgrading to GHES 3.9.

  known_issues:
    - |
      After an administrator upgrades from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."

    - |
      The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
    - |
      When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.

      On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

      ```
      Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID
      ```

      You can safely ignore this message.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
    - |
      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

      - Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
      - Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

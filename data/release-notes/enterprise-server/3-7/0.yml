          Improvements have been made to the creation and management of forks.

          - When forking a repository, users can choose to only include the repository's default branch in the fork.
          - Users can use a repository's' **Fork** button to see existing forks of the repository.
          - The **Fetch upstream** button has been renamed to **Sync fork** to better describe the button's behavior. If the sync causes a conflict, the web UI prompts the user to contribute changes to the parent repository, discard changes, or resolve the conflict.
          - To address situations where people work within one organization and don't want to fork a repository to a different organization or user account, users can fork a repository to the same organization as the parent repository.
          - Users can fork an internal repository to another organization and the fork will retain internal visibility. When forking an internal repository, users can choose which organization should own the fork.

          For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1973
        - |
          Repository administrators can block the creation of branches that match a configured name pattern with the **Restrict pushes that create matching branches** branch protection rule. For example, if a repository's default branch changes from `master` to `main`, a repository administrator can prevent any subsequent creation or push of the `master` branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule)."

          In Markdown, users can write LaTeX-style syntax to render math expressions inline using `$` delimiters, or in blocks using `$$` delimiters. For more information, see "[Writing mathematical expressions](/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)."

      If TLS and subdomain isolation are configured for your instance and your certificate is not a wildcard certificate, you must generate a new certificate that includes the additional subdomains for these services, `notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `viewscreen.HOSTNAME`. For more information, see "[Enabling subdomain isolation](/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/enabling-subdomain-isolation)." [Updated: 2022-12-02]

    - Secret scanning no longer supports custom patterns that use `.*` as an end delimiter in the "After secret" field, as the pattern syntax would cause scan problems and inconsistencies.

    - When creating a new release, users can now submit the form using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> in macOS, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> in Windows or Linux.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2533
    - The **Wiki** tab in a repository only appears when a wiki exists. Previously, the tab always appeared.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2410
    - Rendered wikis display mathematical expressions and Mermaid diagrams.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2534
    - The size of the search field for user, organization, and enterprise audit logs has increased.

      {% data reusables.release-notes.enterprise-backup-utils-encryption-keys %}
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      In some cases after upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0, users may encounter `Internal Server Error` or `500` errors when initiating `git` operations over SSH or HTTPS. Example:

        ```
        git push origin master
        Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
        remote: Internal Server Error
        To ghes.hostname.com:User/repo.git
        ! [remote rejected]       master -> master (Internal Server Error)
        ```

      If these are encountered, please [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) with a support bundle. The known temporary workaround at this time is to restart the `github-gitauth` service with the commands below:

        ```
        nomad stop github-gitauth
        nomad run /etc/nomad-jobs/github/gitauth.hcl
        nomad status github-gitauth
        ```
      We are currently investigating a permanent fix for a future hot patch [Updated: 2022-11-24].

      **Upcoming deprecation**: In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and later, unsecure algorithms will be disabled for SSH connections to the administrative shell.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2395
    - Commit comments, which are comments that users add directly to a commit outside of a pull request, no longer appear in the pull request timeline. Users could not reply to or resolve these comments. The Timeline events REST API and the GraphQL API's `PullRequest` object also no longer return commit comments.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2380
    - Diffing GeoJSON, PSD, and STL files is no longer possible.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2480
    - |
      Package registries on the new GitHub Packages architecture, including Container registry and npm packages, no longer expose data through the GraphQL API. In a coming release, other GitHub Packages registries will migrate to the new architecture, which will deprecate the GraphQL API for those registries as well.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/1569

      **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com). 
  bugs:
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes. 
    - In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output. 
    - If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 could take longer than expected.
    - On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, the correct path appears for manifests that originate from build-time submission snapshots. 
  changes:
    - People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`.

      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.

      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

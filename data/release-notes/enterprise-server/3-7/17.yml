  security_fixes:
    - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
    - To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - When displaying a list of subdomains in the Management Console, the list included the outdated `render` subdomain, and excluded the newer `containers`, `docker`, `notebook`, and `viewscreen` subdomains.
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
    - Duplicated intermediate commit trailers wont appear in pull request squash messages.
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
    - When viewing git blame data, the reviewer menu was loaded even when the suggested reviewer calculation timed out.
    - When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
    - On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
  changes:
    - Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
    - When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - |
      Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

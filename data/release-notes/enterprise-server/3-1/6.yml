  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Attaching very large images or animated GIFs to images or pull requests would fail.
    - Journald messages related to automatic updates (`Adding h/m/s random time.`) were logged to syslog.
    - Custom pre-receive hooks that created named pipes (FIFOs) would crash or hang, resulting in a timeout error.
    - Adding filters to the audit log advanced search page did not populate the query text box in real-time with the correct facet prefix and value.
    - Git hooks to the internal API that result in failing requests returned the exception `undefined method body for "success":String (NoMethodError)` instead of returning an explicit `nil`.
    - When an integration was removed, it was possible for an unrelated OAuth application or integration to also be removed.
    - When a mandatory message containing an emoji character was added, attempting to view or change the message would return a 500 Internal Server Error.
  changes:
    - Adds `triage` and `maintain` to the list of permissions returned by the REST API.
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.

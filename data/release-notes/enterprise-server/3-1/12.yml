  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - Running `ghe-repl-start` or `ghe-repl-status` would sometimes return errors connecting to the database when GitHub Actions was enabled.
    - Pre-receive hooks would fail due to undefined `PATH`.
    - 'Running `ghe-repl-setup` would return an error: `cannot create directory /data/user/elasticsearch: File exists` if the instance had previously been configured as a replica.'
    - 'After setting up a high availability replica, `ghe-repl-status` included an error in the output: `unexpected unclosed action in command`.'
    - In large cluster environments, the authentication backend could be unavailable on a subset of frontend nodes.
    - Some critical services may not have been available on backend nodes in GHES Cluster.
  changes:
    - An additional outer layer of `gzip` compression when creating a cluster support bundle with `ghe-cluster-suport-bundle` is now turned off by default. This outer compression can optionally be applied with the `ghe-cluster-suport-bundle -c` command line option.
    - We have added extra text to the admin console to remind users about the mobile apps' data collection for experience improvement purposes.
  known_issues:
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is enabled for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, teardown of a replica node with `ghe-repl-teardown` will succeed, but may return `ERROR:Running migrations`.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

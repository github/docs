      **MEDIUM**: Malicious URLs for SVG assets provided information about a victim user who clicked the URL, allowing an attacker to retrieve metadata belonging to the user and use it to generate a convincing phishing page. This required the attacker to upload malicious SVGs and phish a victim user to click the URL for the uploaded asset. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9539](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9539). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.

      **HIGH**: An attacker could bypass SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, allowing unauthorized provisioning of users and access to the instance, by exploiting an improper verification of cryptographic signatures vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server. This was a regression introduced as part of follow-up remediation from [CVE-2024-4985](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-4985), which resulted in a new variant of the vulnerability. Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO, or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions, are not impacted. Additionally, an attacker would require direct network access as well as a signed SAML response or metadata document. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-9487](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-9487). This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
  bugs:
    - |
      HAProxy reloading was failure prone, which could lead to failed Git operations. This reloading process has been replaced with a more resilient Systemd process.
    - |
      An unhandled nil value when configuring Actions storage with AWS S3 via OIDC configuration in the terminal could cause an error.
    - |
      On an instance with secret scanning enabled, the custom pattern page would not load because dry run results were tied to a deleted repository.
    - |
      The "List teams" API endpoint returning duplicate results when paginating.
    - |
      A model with no URL could cause a `ghe-migrator` import to fail.
    - |
      Restore could fail when restoring MySQL using backup-utils.
  changes:
    - |
      The `ghe-remove-node` command will display the log file location when running in quiet mode.
    - |
      Pre-receive hook environments can use the `clone3()` system call.
    - |
      The creation, deletion, or change in visibility of a gist has been added to the audit log.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

      Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
    - |
      The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
    - |
      The admin stats REST API endpoints may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.

    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.

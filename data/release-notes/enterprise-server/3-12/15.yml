  {% warning %}

  **Warning**: For instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), hotpatches or upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version `3.12.15` will result errors being reported in the upgrade log. We recommend waiting for the next patch release to hotpatch or upgrade.

      **HIGH**: An attacker could access environment variables in the debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL action after a failed code scanning workflow run. This includes any secrets that were exposed to the workflow as environment variables. The attacker requires read access to the repository to access the debug artifact. Users who do not have debug logging enabled are unaffected. The impact to GitHub Enterprise Server users is limited to internal actors. To mitigate this issue, GitHub no longer logs the complete environment by default. GitHub has requested [CVE-2025-24362](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24362) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      In some cluster-mode configurations, it was not possible to enable GitHub Advanced Security in bulk.
    - |
      In certain cases, on an instance in a cluster configuration, secret scanning would fail to run due to misconfiguration of a Kafka service.
    - |
      In cluster environments, API rate limits were calculated using the cluster node IP address instead of the client IP address. This could lead to incorrect rate limiting and the wrong IP address being recorded in audit log entries.
    - |
      The relative date for commits was sometimes incorrectly displayed in the web UI.
    - |
      In some cluster configurations, secret scanning failed to run normally due to connection failures.
  changes:
    - |
      Log files on the appliance root disk are compressed immediately upon daily rotation instead of after a 24 hour delay. You can revert to the previous `delaycompress` behavior by signing in as an SSH admin user, setting `ghe-config logrotate.delaycompress true` and then running `ghe-config-apply`.
    - |
      The CodeQL action has been updated to v3.28.6 to enable uploading artifacts in debug mode without logging the complete environment when running CodeQL CLI v2.20.3+.
    - |
      The `ghe-live-migrations --init-target` command fails with a descriptive error message if the specified upgrade path is not supported.

    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
    - |
      {% data reusables.release-notes.large-adoc-files-issue %}
    - |
      Repositories originally imported using ghe-migrator will not correctly track Advanced Security contributions.
    - |
      The `reply.[hostname]` subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**. When regenerating the certificates with management console, the `subdomain reply.[hostname]` is missing from the ssl certification.
    - |
      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.

    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      Some customers upgrading from 3.11.x or 3.12.x may experience a bug with the feature "Automatic update checks", filling the root disk with logs causing a system degradation. To prevent this, you can turn off the feature "[Enable automatic update check](/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/enabling-automatic-update-checks#enabling-automatic-update-checks)" in the management console.

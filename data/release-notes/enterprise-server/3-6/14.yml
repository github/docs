      **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com). 
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes. 
    - In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output. 
    - If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error. 
    - If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 could take longer than expected. 
    - GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`. 
  changes:
    - People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`. 
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.

      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.

      In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

      Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.

      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

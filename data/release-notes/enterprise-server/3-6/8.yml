  security_fixes:
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - After a site administrator adjusted the cutoff date for allowing SSH connections with RSA keys using `ghe-config app.gitauth.rsa-sha1`, the instance would still disallow connections with RSA keys if the connection attempt was signed by the SHA-1 hash function. 
    - During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. 
    - When enabling automatic TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt, the process could fail with the error `The certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or the certificate chain in missing intermediate CA signing certificates`. 
    - In some cases, users were unable to convert existing issues to discussions. If an issue is stuck while being converted to a discussion, enterprise owners can review the "Known issues" section below for more information. 
  changes:
    - When a timeout occurs during diff generation, such as when a commit displays an error that the diff is taking too long to generate, the `push` webhook event will deliver empty diff information. Previously, the `push` webhook event would fail to be delivered. 
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

      Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

      If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.

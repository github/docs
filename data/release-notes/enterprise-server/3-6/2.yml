  features:
    - Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field. 
  security_fixes:
    - |
      **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
    - |
      **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - In some cases, collectd could log excessive metrics-related errors in `/var/log/collectd.log`.
    - When configuring the external domain name of a repository cache replica node using `ghe-repl-node --cache-domain`, the command would return an error that prevented Git LFS caching from being enabled.
    - Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
    - Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
    - The option to enable TLS encryption for incoming SMTP connections to an instance was missing from the Management Console.
    - In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
    - Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
    - The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation. 
    - When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
    - A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
    - In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
    - When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
    - Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
    - After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
    - After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
    - Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
    - When viewing a pull request's diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
    - If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
    - Repositories for packages erroneously displayed a "Used by" section.
  changes:
    - '{% data reusables.release-notes.scim-in-3-6-series %} [Updated: 2023-04-17]'
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
    - In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
    - Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

      After upgrading a replica node to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0 or later and restarting replication, in some situations Git replication may stop progressing and continue to show `WARNING: git replication is behind the primary …`. If you encounter this known issue contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)." [Updated: 2022-10-03]

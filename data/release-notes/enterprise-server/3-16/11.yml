      **HIGH:** An attacker could execute code within a victim's browser, potentially accessing sensitive information, by causing malicious HTML to be injected into the DOM when content is rendered by the Filter component found across GitHub. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2025-13744](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-13744) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). [Updated: 2026-01-06]

      **HIGH:** A privilege escalation vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed an authenticated Enterprise admin to gain root SSH access to the appliance by exploiting a symlink escape in pre-receive hook environments. By crafting a malicious repository and environment, an attacker could replace system binaries during hook cleanup and execute a payload that adds their own SSH key to the root user’s authorized keys—thereby granting themselves root SSH access to the server. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needed to have enterprise admin privileges. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2025-11578](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11578) and was reported through the GitHub Bug Bounty program.

      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      Administrators may have experienced delays with configuration runs after a reboot if `ghe-reconfigure.service` was still activating, impacting run performance and stability.
    - |
      On instances with a "No Proxy" setting configured for GitHub Actions with MinIO or AWS remote blob providers, administrators sometimes experienced failures reading or writing Actions logs, artifacts, or caches because some traffic was incorrectly routed through the instances proxy.
    - |
      New Microsoft Teams integrations failed to set up because the required `tenant_id` field was missing from the configuration, following Microsoft's deprecation of multi-tenant bot creation. <!-- markdownlint-disable-line GHD046 -->
    - |
      Site administrators using the Management Console would see overly verbose error messages on the maintenance page. These error messages were not cleared when a new request was made, and no message was displayed when maintenance mode changes were saved successfully.
    - |
      An "Invite member" button intended only for GitHub.com was displayed on the enterprise "People" tab.
    - |
      When a pull request was closed and reopened, the `merge` ref was not recreated.
    - |
      Administrators who had upgraded to the previous patch release may have observed a significant increase in executions of the `SecurityOverviewAnalytics::UpdateFeatureStatusSummaryJob` job, causing background job queue saturation, service delays, reduced stability, and lower performance for environments using security overview analytics.
    - |
      Link previews did not appear in Slack conversations when messages were delivered through socket mode, affecting the visibility of linked GitHub content.
    - |
      Users who accessed GitHub Enterprise Server with Chromium-based browsers experienced slow logout performance.
    - |
      Audit log searches could temporarily miss recent events or show incomplete results right after new index creation at the start of a month. Administrators now experience reduced lag between the creation of monthly audit log search indexes and their availability for searches and write operations.
    - |
      When new Elasticsearch indexes were created, index routing memos could go to a read-only MySQL replica and fail, causing delays in audit log indexing after monthly rollovers. The memos are now written to the primary database rather than a read-only replica.
  changes:
    - |
      A new weekly job automatically disables Elasticsearch deprecation logging and removes existing deprecation logs every Saturday at midnight. This helps administrators manage disk space by regularly cleaning up deprecation data streams and log indices that are no longer needed. <!-- markdownlint-disable-line GHD046 -->
    - |
      Administrators can add security key-backed (SK) SSH certificate authorities.
    - |
      `ghe-repl-start` can now be executed without requiring a maintenance window when setting up a new replica, as long as `ghe-repl-setup` is immediately followed by `ghe-config-apply`. [Updated: 2025-12-17]
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      When initializing a new GHES cluster, nodes with the `consul-server` role should be added to the cluster before adding additional nodes. Adding all nodes simultaneously creates a race condition between nomad server registration and nomad client registration.
    - |
      Admins setting up cluster high availability (HA) may encounter a spokes error when running `ghe-cluster-repl-status` if a new organization and repositories are created before using the `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` command. To avoid this issue, complete the cluster HA setup with `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` before creating new organizations and repositories.
    - |
      In a cluster, the host running restore requires access the storage nodes via their private IPs.
    - |
      On an instance hosted on Azure, commenting on an issue via email meant the comment was not added to the issue.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the Actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      Unexpected elements may appear in the UI on the repository overview page for locked repositories.

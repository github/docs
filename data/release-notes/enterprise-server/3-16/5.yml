  {% warning %}

  **Warning**: We have received a few reports of performance issues with GitHub Enterprise Server versions 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17. Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend holding off on upgrading to these versions until further notice. [Updated: 2025-08-01]

sections:
  security_fixes:
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      The Management Console would become unresponsive when saving settings after a failed config apply run.
    - |
      Users sometimes received a JSON response instead of a web page when clicking "Back" after viewing files in raw format.
    - |
      The secret scanning metrics page displayed data for expired delegated bypass requests.
    - |
      Users could not create or view secret scanning push protection bypass requests for forked repositories because bypass requests were incorrectly associated with the root repository rather than the fork. Forked repositories now support their own bypass requests.
    - |
      When users added a team with a repository role to the `CODEOWNERS` file, an unknown error was displayed. Teams with repository roles are now correctly recognized as valid owners of files.
  changes:
    - |
      The babeld service no longer reports log messages about some common client-induced networking errors, reducing noise in the logs.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Customers operating at high scale or near capacity may experience unexpected performance degradation, such as slow response times, background job queue spikes, elevated CPU usage, and increased MySQL load. Consider upgrading to 3.16 with caution. [Updated: 2025-07-28]
    - |
      Applying a new GitHub Enterprise Server license using the Management Console can sometimes fail with an HTTP 500 error.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

    - |
      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

    - |
      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      When initializing a new GHES cluster, nodes with the `consul-server` role should be added to the cluster before adding additional nodes. Adding all nodes simultaneously creates a race condition between nomad server registration and nomad client registration.
    - |
      Admins setting up cluster high availability (HA) may encounter a spokes error when running `ghe-cluster-repl-status` if a new organization and repositories are created before using the `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` command. To avoid this issue, complete the cluster HA setup with `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` before creating new organizations and repositories.
    - |
      In a cluster, the host running restore requires access the storage nodes via their private IPs.
    - |
      On an instance hosted on Azure, commenting on an issue via email meant the comment was not added to the issue.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.

          The root navigational experience for enterprise accounts lands all users on an "Enterprise Overview". From this page, enterprise owners can create a README for their enterprise, which will be visible internally to all enterprise members. The "Organization" page still exists and can be accessed from the left sidebar of the enterprise account.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3842
        - |
          To improve the pre-flight checks experience, all pre-flight checks run even if one check fails. A consolidated report of the results is shown in the UI.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3870

          People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3887
        - |
          As part of the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13, Elasticsearch (ES) is upgraded from version 5.6.16 to 8.7.0. Upgrading platform components improves performance and security posture. For important upgrade considerations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/preparing-for-the-elasticsearch-upgrade)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3776
        - |
          To improve existing tooling for license handling, the `ghe-license` script handles all operations regarding the active license. Commands can be performed on new licenses without importing them first. The script allows direct application of the license without a full configuration run and avoids restarting the instance to reduce downtime. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-license)."

          Administrators can upload the license to their instance using multiple interfaces, including the Management Console, Manage GHES API, CLI, or SSH. See "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/uploading-a-new-license-to-github-enterprise-server)."

    - heading: Audit logs
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3724
        - |
          Enterprise and organization audit log events include the applicable SAML and SCIM identity data associated with the user. This data provides increased visibility into the identity of the user and enables logs from multiple systems to quickly and easily be linked using a common corporate identity. The SAML identity information displays in the `external_identity_nameid` field and the SCIM identity data displays in the `external_identity_username` field within the audit log payloads. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

           In the secret scanning list view, users can apply a filter to display alerts that are the result of having bypassed push protection. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3180
        - |
          To increase coverage of secret scanning across an instance, users can enable secret scanning in repositories owned by their personal account. Enterprise owners can disable this feature, or automatically enable it for all new user-owned repositories, in the enterprise settings. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/managing-github-advanced-security-features-for-your-enterprise)."

    - heading: Code scanning
      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3526
        - |
          Users can enable code scanning on repositories even if they don’t contain any code written in the [languages currently supported by CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/). Default setup will automatically trigger the first scan when a supported language is detected on the default branch. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning)."
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3545

          The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} action for code scanning analysis uses version 2.16.5 of the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %} by default, an upgrade from 2.15.5 compared to the previous {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} feature release. For a detailed list of changes included in each version, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} change logs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/).
          Significant changes include:
          * Support for Swift 5.9.2, C# 12 / .NET 8, and Go 1.22.
          * Installation of Python dependencies is disabled for all Python scans by default. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-07-12-code-scanning-with-codeql-no-longer-installs-python-dependencies-automatically-for-new-users/).
          * A new `python_executable_name` option for the Python extractor. This allows you to select a non-default Python executable installed on the system running the scan (such as `py.exe` on Windows machines). See the [changelog in the CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.16.3/#new-features).
          * A fix for [CVE-2024-25129](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/security/advisories/GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph), a low-severity data exfiltration vulnerability that could be triggered by processing untrusted databases or CodeQL packs.
          * The code scanning UI now includes partially extracted files. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-23-codeql-2-16-python-dependency-installation-disabled-new-queries-and-bug-fixes/#:~:text=The%20measure%20of,the%20near%20future.).
          * 2 new C/C++ queries: `cpp/use-of-unique-pointer-after-lifetime-ends` and `cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf`
          * 6 new Java queries: `java/insecure-randomness` , `java/exec-tainted-environment` , `java/android/sensitive-text`, `java/android/sensitive-notification`, `java/android/insecure-local-authentication`, and `java/android/insecure-local-key-gen`

          For users who use `devcontainer.json` files to define development containers for repositories, Dependabot version updates can keep "features" defined for the dev container up to date. Once configured in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot will open pull requests on a specified schedule to update the listed features to the latest version. Dependabot security updates for dev containers are not currently supported.

      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2473
        - |
          For enterprises or organizations that use an SSH certificate authority (CA) to provide SSH certificates to members, to protect against a security risk involving user renames, new SSH CAs that are uploaded to a GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13 instance can only be used to sign certificates that are set to expire. For new CAs, you must use the `-V` parameter with `ssh-keygen` to generate a certificate with a `valid-after` claim.

          The `valid-after` claim allows GitHub to validate that the user named in the SSH certificate hasn't been renamed since the certificate was signed. CAs uploaded prior to version 3.13 are exempt from this requirement and can be used to sign certificates that do not expire. However, when you've ensured that your certificate signing process uses the `-V` flag, GitHub encourages you to upgrade existing certificates to enforce the expiration requirement. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority)."

      **Upcoming change:** In version 3.14 and later of GitHub Enterprise Server, for instances with GitHub Actions and GitHub Connect enabled, self-hosted runners that download actions from GitHub.com via GitHub Connect will need to allow access to the following new hosts.

      * `ghcr.io`
      * `*.actions.githubusercontent.com`

      Please update the outbound firewall rules on your self-hosted runners to allow requests to these services. You can make this change on version 3.13, or on a previous version of GitHub Enterprise Server. For a smooth upgrade to version 3.14, we recommend you make changes to your firewall rules now, as failing to do so will result in your runners being unable to download certain actions in version 3.14 and later.

      To ensure security updates are applied correctly regardless of your repository's configuration settings, Dependabot uses private registry configurations specified in the `dependabot.yml` file as expected, even if there is a configuration with `target-branch`.  Security updates still do not support `target-branch` configuration. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot)."

    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      When enabling log forwarding, specific service logs, including babeld, are duplicated. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity-in-your-enterprise/log-forwarding#enabling-log-forwarding)."
    - |
      Repositories originally imported using `ghe-migrator` do not correctly track committers for GitHub Advanced Security billing.
    - |
      When log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
    - |
      Due to a known regression, operators will not be able to use the `ghe-migrations` visualizer to view the status of migrations during an upgrade. Instead, the operator can inspect the log files in `/var/log/dbmigration` to see the status and progress of migrations.
    - |
      `TokenScanningServiceMetricsApiError` errors may appear after the upgrade.
    - |
      The log entry `irb: warn: can't alias delete from irb_delete` may appear during creation and upload of support bundles.
    - |
      The admin stats REST API endpoints may time out on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      When following the steps for "[Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node)," step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` as part of the steps for "[Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency)" might fail with errors if the node being replaced has not first been turned off. If this occurs, turn the node off and repeat the steps.
    - |
      For an instance in a cluster configuration and with GitHub Actions enabled, restoring a cluster from backup requires targeting the primary DB node.
    - |
      Memory utilization may increase after the upgrade. During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient memory allocations for internal components.
    - |
      Following an upgrade, Elasticsearch search migrations are sometimes incorrectly reported as failing in the audit log, even though the migrations completed successfully. [Updated: 2024-08-02]
      
  deprecations:
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2732
    - |
      As part of sunsetting Subversion compatibility, Subversion support is now disabled by default. Subversion can be re-enabled in the 3.13 release series by setting `app.svnbridge.enabled = true`. In 3.14, subversion support will be permanently removed. For more information, see [Sunsetting Subversion support](https://github.blog/2023-01-20-sunsetting-subversion-support/) on the GitHub blog.

      The Manage GHES API reached feature parity with the Management Console API in GHES 3.12. As a result, we will remove the Management Console API in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15. For information about updating tooling that relies on the Management Console API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console)."
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3794
    - |
      From November 19, 2024, references to v1 and v2 of artifacts actions in GitHub Actions will not resolve. GitHub deprecated v1 and v2 of actions/upload-artifact, actions/download-artifact, and related npm packages on June 30, 2024. You can read more about this deprecation on the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-13-deprecation-notice-v1-and-v2-of-the-artifact-actions/). GitHub Enterprise Server instances configured to use GitHub Connect to download these actions will need to store cached copies locally for workflows to continue working. If your local copy of these actions has been removed, use [GitHub Actions Sync](https://github.com/actions/actions-sync) to manually re-download the actions. [Updated: 2024-18-20]
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3794
    - |
      The deprecated v1 and v2 versions of artifacts actions will be removed from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15 onwards. Users should update their workflows to use v3 or later versions of artifacts actions. [Updated: 2024-18-20]
  errata:
    - 'The "[Deprecations](/admin/release-notes#3.13.0-deprecations)" section previously indicated that the Management Console API would be deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.14. Instead, the Management Console API will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15. [Updated: 2024-07-08]'

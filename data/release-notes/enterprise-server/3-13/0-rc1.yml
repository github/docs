          The root navigational experience for enterprise accounts lands all users on an "Enterprise Overview". From this page, enterprise owners can create a README for their enterprise, which will be visible internally to all enterprise members. The "Organization" page still exists and can be accessed from the left sidebar of the enterprise account.
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3842
        - |
          To improve the pre-flight checks experience, all pre-flight checks run even if one check fails. A consolidated report of the results is shown in the UI.

          As part of the upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13, Elasticsearch (ES) is upgraded from version 5.6.16 to 8.7.0. Upgrading platform components improves performance and security posture. For important upgrade considerations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/preparing-for-the-elasticsearch-upgrade)."

        - |
          To improve existing tooling for license handling, the `ghe-license` script handles all operations regarding the active license. Commands can be performed on new licenses without importing them first. The script allows direct application of the license without a full configuration run and avoids restarting the instance to reduce downtime. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-license)."

          Administrators can upload the license to their instance using multiple interfaces, including the Management Console, Manage GHES API, CLI, or SSH. See "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/uploading-a-new-license-to-github-enterprise-server)."

      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3724
        - |
          Enterprise and organization audit log events include the applicable SAML and SCIM identity data associated with the user. This data provides increased visibility into the identity of the user and enables logs from multiple systems to quickly and easily be linked using a common corporate identity. The SAML identity information displays in the `external_identity_nameid` field and the SCIM identity data displays in the `external_identity_username` field within the audit log payloads. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

          The {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} action for code scanning analysis uses version 2.16.5 of the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %} by default, an upgrade from 2.15.5 compared to the previous {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} feature release. For a detailed list of changes included in each version, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} change logs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/).
          Significant changes include:
          * Support for Swift 5.9.2, C# 12 / .NET 8, and Go 1.22.
          * Installation of Python dependencies is disabled for all Python scans by default. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-07-12-code-scanning-with-codeql-no-longer-installs-python-dependencies-automatically-for-new-users/).
          * A new `python_executable_name` option for the Python extractor. This allows you to select a non-default Python executable installed on the system running the scan (such as `py.exe` on Windows machines). See the [changelog in the CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.16.3/#new-features).
          * A fix for [CVE-2024-25129](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/security/advisories/GHSA-gf8p-v3g3-3wph), a low-severity data exfiltration vulnerability that could be triggered by processing untrusted databases or CodeQL packs.
          * The code scanning UI now includes partially extracted files. See the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-23-codeql-2-16-python-dependency-installation-disabled-new-queries-and-bug-fixes/#:~:text=The%20measure%20of,the%20near%20future.).
          * 2 new C/C++ queries: `cpp/use-of-unique-pointer-after-lifetime-ends` and `cpp/incorrectly-checked-scanf`
          * 6 new Java queries: `java/insecure-randomness` , `java/exec-tainted-environment` , `java/android/sensitive-text`, `java/android/sensitive-notification`, `java/android/insecure-local-authentication`, and `java/android/insecure-local-key-gen`

          For enterprises or organizations that use an SSH certificate authority (CA) to provide SSH certificates to members, to protect against a security risk involving user renames, new SSH CAs that are uploaded to a GitHub Enterprise Server 3.13 instance can only be used to sign certificates that are set to expire. For new CAs, you must use the `-V` parameter with `ssh-keygen` to generate a certificate with a `valid-after` claim.

          The `valid-after` claim allows GitHub to validate that the user named in the SSH certificate hasn't been renamed since the certificate was signed. CAs uploaded prior to version 3.13 are exempt from this requirement and can be used to sign certificates that do not expire. However, when you've ensured that your certificate signing process uses the `-V` flag, GitHub encourages you to upgrade existing certificates to enforce the expiration requirement. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise#upgrading-an-ssh-certificate-authority)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3971
    - |
      TCP port 9103 is opened for future administrative features related to support for Prometheus scraping. The port has been open since GitHub Enterprise Server 3.12, but this change wasn't communicated at the time release notes for version 3.12 were first published.
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3940

      **Upcoming change:** In version 3.14 and later of GitHub Enterprise Server, for instances with GitHub Actions and GitHub Connect enabled, self-hosted runners that download actions from GitHub.com via GitHub Connect will need to allow access to the following new hosts.

      * `ghcr.io`
      * `*.actions.githubusercontent.com`

      You can make this change to your firewall rules on version 3.13, or on a previous version of GitHub Enterprise Server. For a smooth upgrade to version 3.14, we recommend you make changes to your firewall rules now, as failing to do so will result in your runners being unable to download certain actions in version 3.14 and later.

      To ensure security updates are applied correctly regardless of your repository's configuration settings, Dependabot uses private registry configurations specified in the `dependabot.yml` file as expected, even if there is a configuration with `target-branch`.  Security updates still do not support `target-branch` configuration. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot)."

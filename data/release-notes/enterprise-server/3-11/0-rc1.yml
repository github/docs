           On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, in repositories that use default setup for code scanning, the default setup configuration updates automatically if GitHub detects new languages. Users can view a repository's language configuration for default setup from the repository's "Code security and analysis" settings page. Additionally, users can view information about setup and debug failed languages from the tools status page. For more information, see the following articles.

           - "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale#about-adding-languages-to-an-existing-default-setup-configuration)"

        - |
          On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, to better protect active and inactive repositories, GitHub Enterprise Server automatically analyzes repositories that use a default setup for code scanning. The analysis runs on a weekly schedule and uses the most recent version of CodeQL. When configuring code scanning, the fixed time for the weekly scan is randomly chosen. The scan will take place at the same time every week, and the schedule is displayed after the setup is completed, so users can easily see when the next scheduled analysis will occur. The scheduled analysis will be automatically disabled if a repository has no activity for six months. Creation of a pull request or pushes to the repository will re-enable scheduled analysis.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3283
        - |
          Code scanning default setup is available for Swift analysis with CodeQL. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically)."

        - |
          For instances with GitHub Connect configured, code scanning with CodeQL supports Java codebases that use [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/). Previously, code scanning users were able to scan Java applications that contained Lombok code, but all the contents of files containing Lombok code were either skipped or users had to apply a workaround to prepare the applications for scanning. Lombok features will now be automatically scanned without requiring any workaround.

          For more information about syncing the required GitHub Actions workflow to scan Lombok code, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions)."

        - |
          To prevent the leak of tokens where users work outside of code, secret scanning detects tokens in both new and historical issue titles, descriptions, and comments. When a new token type is added to secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server scans for matches automatically. This expanded coverage also detects and surfaces secrets that match any custom pattern defined at the repository, organization, or enterprise level. These secrets appear both in the web interface and in queries to the REST API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3402
        - |
          Users can improve the security of deployment environments by configuring a branch protection policy to only allow specific branches to deploy to an environment. Additionally, the following security improvements apply to environments.

          - GitHub Enterprise Server blocks runs triggered from forks with branch names that match the protected branch's name.
          - Tags with the same name as a protected branch cannot deploy to the environments with a branch protection configuration.

          For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3489

      Field names for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed as part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Additional field names were changed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and 3.10. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

      - `level` is now `SeverityText`.
      - `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
      - `now` is now `Timestamp`.
      - Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
      - Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)."

      On an instance that uses built-in authentication or LDAP, if two-factor authentication (2FA) is configured for an organization, a user could use a TOTP code multiple times within the code's window of validity during authentication or when entering sudo mode for sensitive actions. To improve security, this reuse is no longer allowed. External systems with a scripted login flow across multiple parallel jobs may stop working as a result of this change.

      For more information about 2FA, see the following articles.

      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, during analysis of Python projects with code scanning using CodeQL and an advanced setup, GitHub Enterprise Server would automatically install dependencies for the project. Due to improvements to CodeQL, GitHub Enterprise Server no longer needs to fetch these dependencies to analyze a codebase. To improve scan times for Python projects, automatic dependency installation is disabled.

      If you configured code scanning with CodeQL via advanced setup to disable dependency installation, GitHub recommends setting `setup-python-dependencies` to `false` for the configuration.

      On an instance with Dependabot enabled, due to misconfiguration or incompatible versions, Dependabot jobs for a repository can fail. After 30 failed runs, subsequent scheduled jobs will fail immediately until you trigger a check for updates from the dependency graph, or until you update a manifest file. Jobs for Dependabot security updates will still trigger normally.

      On an instance with GitHub Advanced Security, to help users more efficiently review and filter code scanning alerts at scale using the REST API, the `updated_at` field in API responses is improved. The `updated_at` timestamp now represents an alert's most recent state change on the branch that you requested. State changes include an alert being introduced, fixed, dismissed, reopened, or reintroduced. Previously, the `updated_at` timestamp changed frequently, whenever an alert was found in an analysis or the alert state changed. For more information about using the REST API to retrieve code scanning alerts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

    - heading: Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7
      notes:
        - |
          Dependabot updates no longer support Python 3.6 or 3.7, which have reached end-of-life. If a user's code uses these versions, Dependabot will no longer be able to open pull requests in your repository and will log errors. Update to Python 3.8 or later to ensure your code is secure and Dependabot can still run.

          Users will continue to receive Dependabot alerts for dependencies with known vulnerabilities. To resolve these alerts, users can manually upgrade the affected package.

           For more information about Python releases, see [Status of Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions) on the Python website. For more information about supported package managers for Dependabot, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems)."

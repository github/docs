  bugs:
    - When an instance is upgraded with a hotpatch, the instance may lose network connectivity after a reboot.
  known_issues:
    - |
      An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.11 may fail, hanging on the "Reloading system services" screen. The following error will appear in `/var/log/syslog`.

      ```text
      agent: Error starting agent: error="Failed to start Consul server: Failed to start Raft: failed to load any existing snapshots"
      ```

      To address this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
    - |
      On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.

  bugs:
    - When GitHub Actions is enabled without running regular scheduled backups the MSSQL Transaction Log could grow unbounded and can consume all available space on the appliance's Data Disk causing a possible outage.
    - Audit log entries for changes made to "Repository creation" organization settings were inaccurate.
    - Excessive logging of `ActionController::UnknownFormat` exceptions caused unnecessary disk usage.
    - "LDAP `group_dn` values longer than 255 characters would result in errors being logged: `Data truncated for column 'group_dn' at row 1`."
  changes:
    - Abuse rate limits are now called Secondary rate limits, since the behavior they limit is not always abusive.
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - When a replica node is offline in a high availability configuration, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may still route {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} requests to the offline node, reducing the availability of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for users.

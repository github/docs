  {% warning %}

  **Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.10.11-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

  {% endwarning %}
sections:
  security_fixes:
    - |
      As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated in the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API.
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      Running `ghe-repl-node -d` did not validate value length in order to prevent values longer than 20 characters.
    - |
      For an instance in a cluster configuration, during the migration phase of a configuration run, the process of copying configuration updates to all nodes would fail.
    - |
      External collaborators with read-only access were able to run workflows on their pull requests from private forks without approval.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering.
  changes:
    - |
      To aid in understanding the CPU/memory utilization of secret scanning processes, the binary names of nomad workers were updated to differentiate between the different types of secret scanning jobs.
    - |
      A more specific error message is shown when the `ghe-repl-node` command is run on an instance not configured for high availability.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

    - |
      After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
    - |
      {% data reusables.release-notes.2023-11-aws-system-time %}
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

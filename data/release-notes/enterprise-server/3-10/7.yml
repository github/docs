     Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
   - |
      On startup, Elasticsearch logged an innocuous JMX MBeans registration error.
   - |
      Hunk headers in C# files did not correctly display changed functions.
   - |
      Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log due to an incomplete bug fix.
   - |
      When restoring a deleted repository, some metadata associated with the repository, such as packages or project items, did not properly restore.
   - |
      On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
   - |
      During Git data server maintenance, a process that was ran on unsupported GitHub Enterprise Server topologies created a significant amount of system logs but did not perform any repair work.
  changes:
    - |
      The default 30 second webhook delivery HTTP timeout can be configured.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

      After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.

      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

  **Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.10.2-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

  {% endwarning %}
sections:
  bugs:
    - On an instance in a high-availability, geo-replication, or repository cache configuration, prolonged replication issues could occur on replica nodes due to failure of `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

      After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.

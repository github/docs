  {% warning %}

  **Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.10.16-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

sections:
  features:
    - |
      Users can view the app state of gists, networks, and wikis in the `spokesctl info` output, enhancing visibility into the status of these elements. Additionally, `spokesctl check` can diagnose and, in most cases, fix empty repository networks, improving network management.
  security_fixes:
    - |
      **CRITICAL:** On GitHub Enterprise Server instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with specific IdPs utilizing publicly exposed signed federation metadata XML, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user account with site administrator privileges. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose the issue contents from a private repository using a GitHub App with only `contents: read` and `pull requests: write` permissions. This was only exploitable via user access token, and installation access tokens were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6337](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6337) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, during a hotpatch upgrade, a race condition could block various upgrade activities.
    - |
      The `ghe-config-apply` process made an unnecessary number of connections to Redis.
    - |
      Instances installed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) could have their hostname overwritten by GCP when a hotpatch was applied.
    - |
      The minimum password requirements for Management Console users and the root site administrator required an upper case character when providing a password with a minimum of 8 characters, contradicting the documentation and password hint.
    - |
      On an instance with subdomain isolation enabled, configuration runs created subdomains for ChatOps services, such as `slack.HOSTNAME` and `teams.HOSTNAME`, regardless of whether the service was enabled.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to an insufficient wait time, MS SQL and MySQL replication could fail with the error message `Failed to start nomad service!`.
    - |
      Some users were unable to delete project views.
    - |
      Due to a regression introduced in a previous patch, for enterprises that use encrypted SAML assertions, SSO attempts failed with a digest mismatch error if the entire SAML response was signed, rather than just the assertions.
    - |
      Running `go get` for a Golang repository with a directory structure that overlaps with GitHub UI routes failed
    - |
      The `github-stream-processor` service could get into a state where it would continually fail to process messages with a `TRILOGY_CLOSED_CONNECTION` error.
    - |
      A corrupted entry in the Git audit log could cause out of memory errors.
    - |
      Fixes and improvements for the git core module.
  changes:
    - |
      Actions KPI logs are disabled by default to reduce log size.
    - |
      Audit log events related to audit log streaming are available in the enterprise audit log page, and via audit log streaming.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

      After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
    - |
      {% data reusables.release-notes.2023-11-aws-system-time %}
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

    - |
      The `reply.HOSTNAME` subdomain is falsely displayed as having no SSL and DNS record, when testing the domain settings via the Management Console without subdomain isolation.
    - |
      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.
    - |
      If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      Services may respond with a `503` status due to an out of date `haproxy` configuration. This can usually be resolved with a `ghe-config-apply` run.
  errata:
    - |
      These release notes previously indicated as a known issue that on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10.16 when log forwarding is enabled, some forwarded log entries may be duplicated.
      The fix for this problem was already included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.10.15](/admin/release-notes#3.10.15-bugs). [Updated: 2024-09-16]

  security_fixes:
    - |
      **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode)."

      This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
    - |
      **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
    - |
      **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
    - |
      **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
    - |
      **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
    - |
      To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - |
      In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
    - |
      On an instance in a high availability configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-repl-status` command-line utility may have seen a status of `UNKNOWN` for the MSSQL service.
    - |
      When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-config-apply` utility may have seen the extraneous message "Error: Server closed the connection" in the logs for the utility.
    - |
      Some OAuth applications did not have device code flow (DCF) explicitly enabled, which prevented DCF from running correctly.
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
    - |
      On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
    - |
      Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server from Visual Studio Code with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
    - |
      In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
    - |
      On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
    - |
      In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
    - |
      Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
    - |
      On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
    - |
      Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
    - |
      Some responses from the REST API included an incorrect URL in the `link` header.
    - |
      After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
    - |
      In some cases, `/stafftools/users/:login` incorrectly displayed trade screening information.
    - |
      Deprecated `resource_activity` jobs were not processed and accumulated over time in the queue, causing possible memory issues.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
    - |
      After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Connect and unified search enabled, users trying to view the unified search code results would get a 500 error.
    - |
      On some instances, the user interface displayed a codespace button, even though GitHub Codespaces is not supported on GitHub Enterprise Server.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
    - |
      An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
    - |
      On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
    - |
      The enterprise account pages on some installations rendered very slowly.
    - |
      A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
    - |
      When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
    - |
      Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log.
    - |
      Running `ghe-spokesctl gov info` without any arguments caused a `panic` response.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, code scanning would report an incorrect number of files scanned on the "Tools" status page.
  changes:
    - |
      On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
    - |
      When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
    - |
      An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
    - |
      To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
    - |
      To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
    - |
      When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
    - |
      The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.

      After an administrator enables maintenance mode from the instance's Management Console UI using Firefox, the administrator is redirected to the Settings page, but maintenance mode is not enabled. To work around this issue, use a different browser.
    - |
      On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

  deprecations:
    - heading: Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key
      notes:
        - |
          To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

          To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.

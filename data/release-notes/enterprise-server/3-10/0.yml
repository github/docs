      notes:
        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2798
        - |
          To find vulnerabilities in specific parts of a project, users with write access to a repository can filter code scanning alerts by language or by file path by using the search queries `language:` and `path:`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2844
        - |
          To help repository administrators and security managers quickly enable automatic code scanning without needing to configure a workflow, default setup for code scanning supports compiled languages including Go, Java, and C. Default setup is now available for all languages supported by CodeQL, except Swift. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages)" and [Supported languages and frameworks](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/) in the CodeQL documentation.

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2843
        - |
          Repository administrators and security managers can choose which languages to include or exclude in default setup for code scanning. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning)."

        - |
          To prevent unnecessary repository removal, the API for managing the repositories accessible by a GitHub App in your organization has been updated to fail early if the application is currently granted access to `all` repositories in the organization. This API can only be used to remove a repository when the application has been granted access to an explicit list of repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/installations#remove-a-repository-from-an-app-installation)."

        # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2610

  changes:
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3398
    - |
      Field names and destinations for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed in this release and the prior release. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

      - `level` is now `SeverityText`.
      - `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
      - `now` is now `Timestamp`.
      - Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
      - Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)."

      For a full list of field mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv) and the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV for GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10](/assets/ghes-3.10-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv). This change is part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and additional field names will change in upcoming releases.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3134
    - |
      Users who use pull requests with protected branches may be affected by the following security measures.

      - Merge commits created locally and pushed to a protected branch are rejected if the contents of the commit differ from the merge commit predicted by GitHub.
      - If the branch protection rule for dismissing stale reviews is active, an approving review is dismissed if the merge base changes after the review was submitted. The merge base is the commit that is the latest common ancestor of the pull request branch and the protected branch.
      - A pull request approval only counts towards the pull request it was submitted for. Previously, approvals were gathered across multiple independent pull requests if the pull request branches pointed to the same commit and targeted the same base branch.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3233
    - |
      The `PUT` and `DELETE` operations on the `/installations/{installation_id}/repositories/{repository_id}` endpoint are no longer functional for the management of GitHub App installations. You can add or remove a repository from an app installation using the documented APIs instead. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/installations)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2870
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to make it easier to assess vulnerabilities to exposed secrets, enterprise owners and organization owners receive a single email with the results of the historical scan for secrets that is performed when secret scanning is first enabled in an organization or enterprise. Previously, secret scanning sent an email for each repository where secrets were detected. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning#about-secret-scanning-alerts-for-users)."

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/2805
    - |
      On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in the "Files changed" view of pull requests, GitHub only displays code scanning alerts for vulnerabilities detected in lines that a pull request has changed. Previously, code scanning displayed all alerts unique to the pull request branch, even if they were unrelated to the changes the pull request introduced.

  backups:
    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3361
    - |
      To generate backups of an instance more quickly, in GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later, the job for pruning snapshots is no longer performed as part of the `ghe-backup` tool. Site administrators can prune snapshots manually or on a schedule by running the `ghe-prune-snapshots` job. For more information, see [Scheduling backups](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/blob/master/docs/scheduling-backups.md) in the `github/backup-utils` repository.

    # https://github.com/github/releases/issues/3365
    - |
      To reduce the data transfer required to regularly back up an instance, GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.10.0 and later allows administrators to perform incremental backups of a MySQL 8 database. For more information, see [Making a Differential or Incremental Backup](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-enterprise-backup/8.0/en/mysqlbackup.incremental.html) in the MySQL documentation.

    - |
      After an administrator upgrades from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."

      When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
    - |
      On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

      ```shell
      Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID
      ```

      You can safely ignore this message.
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
    - |
      When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell.

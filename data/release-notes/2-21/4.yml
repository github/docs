    - '**CRITICAL:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Pages that could allow an attacker to execute commands as part building a GitHub Pages site. This issue was due to an outdated and vulnerable dependency used in the Pages build process. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance.  This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server. To mitigate this vulnerability, Kramdown has been updated to address CVE-2020-14001. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/pages/pull/2835, https://github.com/github/pages/pull/2827 {% endcomment %}'
    - '**HIGH:** High: An attacker could inject a malicious argument into a Git sub-command when executed on GitHub Enterprise Server. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files with partially user-controlled content and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to access repositories within the GHES instance. However, due to other protections in place, we could not identify a way to actively exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability was reported through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/150936, https://github.com/github/github/pull/150634 {% endcomment %}'

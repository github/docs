If the source or destination of your migration uses an IP allow list (either {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s IP allow list feature or your identity provider's (IdP) IP allow list restrictions, such as Azure CAP), you need to configure IP allow lists on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

* If you use {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s IP allow list feature, you must add the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} IP ranges below to the allow list for the source and/or destination organizations.
* If you use your IdP's IP allow list to restrict access to your enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you should disable these restrictions in your enterprise account settings until after your migration is complete.

**40 GB size limit for a Git repository ({% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %}):** This limit applies only to the source code. To check if the repository archive is over the limit, use the [git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) tool and review the total blob size in the output. The git-sizer tool also helps to identify potential issues related to large files, blob size, commit size, and tree counts that could impact migrations.

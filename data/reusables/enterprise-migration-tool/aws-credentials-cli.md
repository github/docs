When you're ready to run your migration, you will need to provide your AWS credentials to the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}: region, access key, secret key, and session token (if required). You can pass them as arguments, or set environment variables called `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.

You will also need to pass in the name of the S3 bucket using the `--aws-bucket-name` argument.

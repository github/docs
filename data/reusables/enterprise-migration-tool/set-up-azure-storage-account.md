In Azure, create a storage account and make a note of your connection string. For more information, see [Manage storage account access keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#regenerate-access-keys) in Microsoft Docs.

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} does not delete your archive from Azure Blob Storage after your migration is finished. To reduce storage costs, we recommend configuring auto-deletion of your archive after a period of time. For more information, see [Optimize costs by automatically managing the data lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview) in Microsoft Docs.

You can run your migration with either the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} or the API.

The {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} simplifies the migration process and is recommended for most customers. Advanced customers with heavy customization needs can use the API to build their own integrations with {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %}.

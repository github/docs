Review the migration log for each migrated repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/accessing-your-migration-logs-for-github-enterprise-importer)."

If the migration failed, the log may contain additional information about the cause of the failure.

If the migration succeeded, there may be warnings in the migration log representing specific pieces of data (for example pull requests, issues, or comments) which were not migrated or were migrated with caveats.

For more information on understanding migration warnings, see "[AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/completing-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer/troubleshooting-your-migration-with-github-enterprise-importer#understanding-migration-log-warnings)." After reviewing any migration warnings, you will need to make a decision about whether you can accept those warnings and move forward.

Determine your timeline, which will largely dictate your approach. The first step for determining your timeline is to get an inventory of what you need to migrate. To gather this data, use the [`gh-repo-stats` extension](https://github.com/mona-actions/gh-repo-stats/) for the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. This open-source tool generates a report that details how much data there is to migrate for an organization.

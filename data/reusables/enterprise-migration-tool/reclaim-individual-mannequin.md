- To reclaim an individual mannequin, replace DESTINATION with the destination organization, MANNEQUIN with the login of mannequin, and USERNAME with the username of the organization member that corresponds to the mannequin.

    If there are multiple mannequins with the same login, you can replace `--mannequin-user MANNEQUIN` with `--mannequin-ID ID`, replacing ID with the ID of the mannequin.

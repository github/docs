When you start a migration, a single repository and its accompanying data migrates into a brand new {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository that you identify.

If you want to move multiple repositories at once from the same source organization, you can queue multiple migrations. You can run up to 5 repository migrations at the same time.

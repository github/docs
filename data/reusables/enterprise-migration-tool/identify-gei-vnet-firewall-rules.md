Customers with Azure Blob Storage configured for storing repository data for migrations must add virtual network firewall rules to their storage accounts to allow GEI to access the repository data. This requires the use of the Azure CLI or PowerShell, as adding these virtual network firewall rules on the Azure Portal is currently unsupported. The following virtual network subnet IDs must be added to the virtual network firewall rules for your storage account:

* `/subscriptions/495e10ff-6097-4190-a1de-b031fcb96f66/resourceGroups/ghr-network-service-4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3-eastus2/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3/subnets/4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3`
* `/subscriptions/d3bde7c9-46be-429b-81a8-258387be6dde/resourceGroups/ghr-network-service-4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3-westus3/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3/subnets/4c5846fa-dc07-4153-8d08-a16a9b437a5a-3`

To add the virtual network firewall rules to your Azure Storage account, you can follow step 5 in the documentation for [creating a virtual network rule for Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security-virtual-networks?tabs=azure-cli) using the network subnet IDs provided above. Be sure to provide the `--subscription` argument with the subscription ID tied to the storage account.

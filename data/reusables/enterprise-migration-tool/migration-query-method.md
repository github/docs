To make GraphQL queries, you'll need to write your own scripts or use an HTTP client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

To learn more about getting started with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} GraphQL API, including how to authenticate, see [AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql).

You will send all GraphQL queries to the **destination** of your migration. If you're migrating to {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency %}, make sure to send queries to the endpoint for your enterprise's subdomain of {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}.

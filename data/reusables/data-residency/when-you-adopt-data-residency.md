When you adopt {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency %}, you can choose where your company's code and data are stored. Your enterprise will be hosted on a dedicated subdomain of {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}.

Data residency makes it easy to separate open source and enterprise work, and helps you meet specific data residency compliance requirements.

The available regions are:

* EU
* Australia
* US

In the future, {% data variables.product.github %} plans to offer {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_short %} in more regions.

For each dependency, you can see the version, {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}license information,{% endif %} the manifest file which included it, and whether it has known vulnerabilities. For package ecosystems supporting transitive dependencies, the relationship status will be displayed and you can click "{% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Show dependency options" %}", then "Show paths", to see the transitive path which brought in the dependency.

You can also search for a specific dependency using the search bar. Dependencies are sorted automatically with vulnerable packages at the top.

For each dependency, you can see the version, {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}license information,{% endif %} the manifest file which included it, and whether it has known vulnerabilities. For package ecosystems supporting transitive dependencies, the relationship status will be displayed and the disclosure button **...** will show the transitive path which brought in the dependency. For more information about transitive dependency support, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/dependency-graph-supported-package-ecosystems).

You can also search for a specific dependency using the search bar. Dependencies are sorted automatically with vulnerabilities at the top.

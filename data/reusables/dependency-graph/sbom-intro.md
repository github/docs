An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of a project's dependencies and associated information (such as {% ifversion ghes %}versions and package identifiers{% else %}versions, package identifiers, licenses, and copyright information{% endif %}). SBOMs help reduced supply chain risks by:

* providing transparency about the dependencies used by your repository
* allowing vulnerabilities to be identified early in the process
* providing insights in the license compliance, security, or quality issues that may exist in your codebase
* enabling you to better comply with various data protection standards

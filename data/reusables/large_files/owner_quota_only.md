Bandwidth and storage usage only count against the repository owner's account. In forks, bandwidth and storage usage count against the root of the repository network. Anyone with write access to a repository can push files to {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} without affecting their personal bandwidth and storage{% ifversion enhanced-billing-platform %} usage{% else %} quotas or purchasing data packs{% endif %}. Forking and pulling a repository counts against the parent repository's bandwidth usage.

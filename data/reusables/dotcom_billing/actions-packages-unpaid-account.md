If your account has outstanding unpaid charges:

- The storage or minutes included in your account for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} will not be reset until the payment has been successfully processed.
- For accounts with storage or minutes remaining for the current billing period, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} will continue to be available until any included usage has been reached.
- For accounts that have reached the included usage for the current billing period for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, both {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} will be disabled to prevent any further overages.

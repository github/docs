The board layout spreads your issues, pull requests, and draft issues across customizable columns. You can create a kanban board by setting your column field to a "Status" field or set any other single select or iteration field as the column field.

You can drag {% ifversion projects-v2-board-drag-multiple %}individual or multiple items{% else %}items{% endif %} from column to column and the value of {% ifversion projects-v2-board-drag-multiple %}those items{% else %}the item{% endif %} will adjust to match the column you drag them to.

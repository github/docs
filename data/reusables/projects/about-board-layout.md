The board layout spreads your issues, pull requests, and draft issues across customizable columns. You can create a kanban board by setting your column field to a "Status" field or set any other single select or iteration field as the column field.

You can drag individual or multiple items from column to column and the value of those items will adjust to match the column you drag them to.

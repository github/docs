You can configure a view to show the sum of one of more number fields, including a count of items in the group or column. For example, if you have a number field tracking the number of hours each item may take to complete, you can display of sum of those hours for each group or column.

In a board layout, field sums are displayed at the top of each column. In table{% ifversion projects-v2-roadmaps %} and roadmap layouts{% else %} layout{% endif %}, when you enable grouping by a field, field sums are included in each group's header.

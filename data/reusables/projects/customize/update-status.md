When items are grouped, if you drag an item to a new group, the value of that group is applied. For example, if you group by "Status" and then drag an item with a status of `In progress` to the `Done` group, the status of the item will switch to `Done`. Similarly, when you add a new item to a group, the new item is populated with the value of the group.

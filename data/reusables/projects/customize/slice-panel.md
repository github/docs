You can slice your items by a field to view a list of the field values in a separate panel. When you click on a value in the slice panel, the current view will adjust to only show items with that value. The slice panel works with the current filter applied to your view.

{% note %}

**Note:** You cannot slice by title, reviewers, or linked pull requests.

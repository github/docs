Reminders will only be triggered for up to five repositories per scheduled reminder. Users can either select up to five specific repositories or allow the system to automatically choose the five repositories with the oldest average pull request age. For each repository, up to 20 of the oldest pull requests will be shown.

> [!NOTE]
> Reminders are not sent when changes are merged from upstream into a fork.

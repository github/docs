Each reminder is only triggered for up to **five** repositories. Users can either select up to five specific repositories, or allow the system to automatically choose the five repositories with the oldest average pull request age. For each repository, up to 20 of the oldest pull requests will be shown.

This limit is **per reminder configuration** and **per repository owner**. If you want reminders for more than five repositories per owner, you can configure additional reminders.

> [!NOTE]
> Reminders are not sent when changes are merged from upstream into a fork.

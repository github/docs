If your app uses third-party services, they should be used in a secure manner:

- Any services used by your app should have a unique login and password.
- Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service.
- Only employees with administrative duties should have admin access to the infrastructure that hosts your app.

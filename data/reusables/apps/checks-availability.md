Write permission for the REST API to interact with checks is only available to {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %} and authenticated users can view check runs and check suites, but they are not able to create them. If you aren't building a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}, you might be interested in using the REST API to interact with [commit statuses](/rest/commits#commit-statuses).

You can also transfer ownership of a **private** or **internal** app from a user or organization to an enterprise account that the owner belongs to. When you do this:

* The app's visibility becomes **internal** if it was not previously, making it available to install in any organization in the enterprise. The app is not uninstalled from any organization.
* The app is uninstalled from all user accounts. Because transfers are limited to private and internal apps, this will only ever be your own user account.

For more information about app visibility, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/making-a-github-app-public-or-private).

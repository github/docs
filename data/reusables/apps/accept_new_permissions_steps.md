1. Click **Save changes** at the bottom of the page.
1. If you've installed the app on your account, check your email and follow the link to accept the new permissions. Any time you change your app's permissions or webhooks, users who have installed the app (including yourself) will need to accept the new permissions before the changes take effect. You can also accept the new permissions by navigating to your [installations page](https://github.com/settings/installations). You'll see a link under the app name, letting you know that the app is requesting different permissions. Click **Review request**, and then click **Accept new permissions**.

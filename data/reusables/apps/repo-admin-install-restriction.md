Repository admins can install {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} in the organization that owns the repository if the app does not request any organization permissions nor the "repository administration" permission. When doing so, they can only install the app with access to the repositories that they admin. {% ifversion fpt or ghec or ghes > 3.19 %}Organization owners can restrict {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} installation by repository admins. When this restriction is enabled, repository admins cannot install {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and must instead request that organization owners install the desired app. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/limiting-oauth-app-and-github-app-access-requests).{% endif %}

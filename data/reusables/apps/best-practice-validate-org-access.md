When you use a user access token, you should track which organizations the token is authorized for. If an organization uses SAML SSO and a user has not performed SAML SSO, the user access token will not have access to that organization. You can use the `GET /user/installations` REST API endpoint to verify which organizations a user access token has access to. If the user is not authorized to access an organization, you should prevent their access to organization owned data within your own application until they perform SAML SSO. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/installations#list-app-installations-accessible-to-the-user-access-token)."

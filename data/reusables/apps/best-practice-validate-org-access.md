When you sign in a user, you should track which organizations the user's token is authorized for. This can change over time after sign in as users are removed from organizations. If an organization uses SAML SSO and a user has not performed SAML SSO, the user access token will not have access to that organization. You should use the `GET /user/installations` REST API endpoint regularly to verify which organizations a user access token has access to. If the user is not authorized to access an organization, you should prevent their access to organization owned data within your own application until they perform SAML SSO or rejoin the organization. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/installations#list-app-installations-accessible-to-the-user-access-token).

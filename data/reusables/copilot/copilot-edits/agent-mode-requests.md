When you use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_agent_short %} mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using the included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do **not** count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.

The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).

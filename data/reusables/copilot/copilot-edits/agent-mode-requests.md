When you use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_agent_short %} mode, each prompt you send counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model's rate. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do not count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billedâ€”tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.

The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).

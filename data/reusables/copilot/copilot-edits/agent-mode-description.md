**Agent mode**: Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

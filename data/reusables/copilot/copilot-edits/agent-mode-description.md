**Agent mode** (public preview): Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete. Agent mode is only available in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}.

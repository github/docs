Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:
* Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
* You want {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
* The task requires {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

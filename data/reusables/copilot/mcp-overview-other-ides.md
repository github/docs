The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, enabling them to work together more effectively.

You can use MCP to extend the capabilities of {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} by integrating it with a wide range of existing tools and services. You can also use MCP to create new tools and services that work with {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}, allowing you to customize and enhance your experience.

For more information on MCP, see [the official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

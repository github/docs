   * Click **Start Implementation** to switch {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} to agent mode and start an agent session to implement the required changes, based on the implementation plan.
   * Click **Open in Editor** to switch {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} to agent mode and start an agent session that generates Markdown, in a tab of your editor, with the details of the implementation plan. You can start to work through the plan yourself, or save the plan as a Markdown file for later use.

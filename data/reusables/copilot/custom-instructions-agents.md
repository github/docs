You can create one or more `AGENTS.md` files, stored anywhere within the repository. When {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is working, the nearest `AGENTS.md` file in the directory tree will take precedence. For more information, see the [openai/agents.md repository](https://github.com/openai/agents.md).

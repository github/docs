> Beginning November 1, 2025, knowledge bases will be {% data variables.release-phases.retired %} and fully replaced by {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces %}. {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces_short %} let you combine code and free-text content—like transcripts or specs—and can be created by any {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} user, not just organization owners. They're a good option for more focused or task-specific use cases. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-spaces/about-organizing-and-sharing-context-with-copilot-spaces).

#### User Engagement Data

When you use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, it collects information about your interactions with the IDE or editor. This includes actions like accepting or dismissing suggestions, as well as general usage data and error information. The purpose of collecting this data is to measure metrics such as latency and feature engagement. Some of this information may include personal data, but it is stored in a way that does not directly identify you.

Enterprises and organizations can choose to enable or disable use of MCP for members of their organization or enterprise with the **MCP servers in {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}** policy. The policy is disabled by default. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/administer/enterprises/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise) and [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies). The MCP policy **only** applies to users who have a {% data variables.copilot.copilot_business_short %} or {% data variables.copilot.copilot_enterprise_short %} subscription from an organization or enterprise that configures the policy. {% data variables.copilot.copilot_free_short %}, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_pro_short %}, or {% data variables.copilot.copilot_pro_plus_short %} **do not** have their MCP access governed by this policy.

> Billing for premium requests is coming soon. Until then, you can continue to use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} premium models without being billed for additional premium requests. We’ll update this article with the latest start date and with a banner on the {% data variables.product.github %} website at least two business days in advance.
>
> When billing begins, your premium request counter will be reset to zero and you will be able to track your usage. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/monitoring-your-copilot-usage-and-entitlements).
>
> Certain requests may experience rate limits.
> * Rate limits restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific time period.
> * High demand may result in rate limiting.

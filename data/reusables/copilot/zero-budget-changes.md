Many accounts have a default $0 budget for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} premium requests. Premium requests over the allowance are rejected unless this budget is edited or deleted.

> [!NOTE] Accounts with a **{% data variables.copilot.copilot_business_short %}** or **{% data variables.copilot.copilot_enterprise_short %}** plan that started after August 22, 2025, do **not** have the default $0 budget, and premium requests are uninterrupted by default. You can limit spending on premium requests by creating a budget or disabling the "Premium request paid usage" policy.

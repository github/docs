For organizations, the ability to use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} is controlled by policy settings for the organization. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/adding-copilot-coding-agent-to-organization).

If the organization is owned by an enterprise, enablement may be controlled at the enterprise level. See [AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/adding-copilot-coding-agent-to-enterprise).

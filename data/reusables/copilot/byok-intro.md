>Some models require the Responses API which is not currently supported.

You can bring your own API keys to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, and enable teams to use your preferred large language model (LLM) providers with {% data variables.copilot.copilot_byok_supported_features %}.

API keys from the following providers are supported:

* Anthropic
* Microsoft Foundry
* OpenAI
* xAI

Fine-tuned models are also supported, but functionality and quality of results can vary depending on the fine-tuning setup. You should test your model and review its outputs carefully before using it in production.

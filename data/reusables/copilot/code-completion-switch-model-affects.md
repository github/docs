> [!NOTE] The list of available models will change over time. When only one code completion model is available, the model picker will only show that model. Preview models and additional code completion models will be added to the picker as they become available.

For details of how to switch the model for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion).

## Effects of switching the AI model

Changing the model that's used for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion does not affect the model that's used by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} next edit suggestions or {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat).

There are no changes to the data collection and usage policy if you change the AI model.

If you are on a {% data variables.copilot.copilot_free_short %} plan, all completions count against your completions quota regardless of the model used. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot#comparing-copilot-subscriptions).

The setting to enable or disable suggestions that match public code are applied irrespective of which model you choose. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).

## Enabling the model switcher

If you have a {% data variables.copilot.copilot_free_short %} or {% data variables.copilot.copilot_pro_short %} plan, the model switcher for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion is automatically enabled.

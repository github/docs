**o3-mini:** This model is the next generation of reasoning models, following from o1 and o1-mini. The o3-mini model outperforms o1 on coding benchmarks with response times that are comparable to o1-mini, providing improved quality at nearly the same latency. It is best suited for code generation and small context operations. You can make 50 requests to this model every 12 hours. Learn more about the [model's capabilities](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o3-mini) and review the [model card](https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/). o3-mini is hosted on Azure.

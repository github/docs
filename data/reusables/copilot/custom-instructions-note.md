## Repository custom instructions in use

The instructions in the file(s) are available for use by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} as soon as you save the file(s). The complete set of instructions will be automatically added to requests that you submit to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in the context of that repository. For example, they are added to the prompt you submit to {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}.

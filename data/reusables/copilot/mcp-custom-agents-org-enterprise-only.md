> MCP servers can only be configured directly within {% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agent_short %} profiles at the organization and enterprise level. Repository-level {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_short %} cannot have MCP servers configured directly in their profiles, but can use tools from MCP servers configured in the repository's settings.

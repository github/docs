> [!NOTE] Personal custom instructions take priority over repository custom instructions, but both are incorporated into the final prompt provided to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}. Whenever possible, you should avoid providing conflicting personal and repository instructions. If you are concerned about response quality, you can also choose to temporarily disable repository instructions. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions).

When you assign {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} posts comments to the pull request. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.

When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} until your quota resetsâ€”unless you upgrade your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plan or enable additional premium requests.

### Language support

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %} supports all languages.

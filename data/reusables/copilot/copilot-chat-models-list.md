For those enrolled in the model selection {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}, the following models are currently available:

* `gpt-4o`: This is the default {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} model. It is a versatile, multimodal model that excels in both text and image processing and is designed to provide fast, reliable responses. It also has superior performance in non-English languages.
* `o1-preview`: This model is focused on advanced reasoning and solving complex problems, in particular in math and science. It responds more slowly than the `gpt-4o` model. You can make 10 requests to this model per day.
* `o1-mini`: This is the faster version of the `o1-preview` model, balancing the use of complex reasoning with the need for faster responses. It is best suited for code generation and small context operations. You can make 50 requests to this model per day.

For more information on these models, see [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/models) in the OpenAI Platform documentation.

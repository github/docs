Permissions vary by extension, depending on the level of authorization that the extension requires in order to respond to your query. You can view the required permissions on the extension’s installation page, located after the billing information step and before the install and authorize step.

**For developers**: At a minimum, the **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}** permissions must be set to "Read-only". Additional permissions may include executing write actions on other surfaces and authorizing read access to repository and organization level data in {% data variables.product.github %}.

**For builders**: In addition to the above, you may also request local context from a user’s editor to further tailor responses. To do so, the **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} Editor Context** permissions must be set to "Read-only". Users will be notified to provide the required authorization.

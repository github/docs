* **Agents** are for complex integrations that need full control over how requests are processed and responses are generated. They let you implement custom logic, integrate with other LLMs and/or the Copilot API, manage conversation context, and handle all aspects of the user interaction. While Agents require more engineering and maintenance, they offer maximum flexibility for sophisticated workflows.

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %} is a purpose-built product that uses a carefully tuned mix of models, prompts, and system behaviors to deliver consistent, high-quality feedback across a wide range of codebases. Model switching is not supported, as changing the model is likely to compromise reliability, user experience, and the quality of review comments.

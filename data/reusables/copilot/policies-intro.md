When an organization owner assigns a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license to a member of their organization, the user's access to features and models is controlled by policies.

Enterprise owners can define a policy for the whole enterprise, or delegate the decision to individual organization owners. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/policies).

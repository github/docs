If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

* When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
* When a response in {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} includes matching code.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code referencing identifies and attributes code suggestions by linking them to their original public sources, helping you understand where the code originates.

If you, or your organization, have allowed suggestions that match public code, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

* When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
* When a response in {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} includes matching code.

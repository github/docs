1. Review the comma-separated (CSV) file in `/PATH/REPO-NAME.git/git-import/raw-authors.csv`. It should contain these columns:
   * `ID`: The author as stored in the original repository, followed by a unique identifier
   * `NAME`: The author as stored in the original repository

   To map authors from the original repository to an email address and name, create a new CSV file with the columns `ID,(ignored),GIT_EMAIL,GIT_NAME`. You can use this CSV file to replace the author information for anything by "ID" with "GIT_EMAIL" and "GIT_NAME".

   For example, if you want to map the original author ID of `octocat@111111-2222-3333-4444-55555555555` to a new user with the email address of `octocat@github.com` and name of `The Octocat`, the CSV file should include the line:

   `octocat@111111-2222-3333-4444-55555555555, ,octocat@github.com,The Octocat`

Many of the resources on this API provide a shortcut for getting information about the currently authenticated user. If a request URL does not include a `{username}` parameter then the response will be for the logged in user (and you must pass [authentication information](/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication) with your request).{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} Additional private information, such as whether a user has two-factor authentication enabled, is included when authenticated through basic auth or OAuth with the `user` scope.{% endif %}

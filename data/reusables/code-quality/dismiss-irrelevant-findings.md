You can dismiss a finding if it isn’t relevant or actionable in the context of your codebase. Common reasons to dismiss a finding include:

* The finding is in legacy code that’s no longer maintained.
* It’s a known exception to your team’s coding standards.
* It’s a false positive that doesn’t pose a real quality risk.

Dismissing irrelevant alerts keeps your quality checks focused on meaningful issues.

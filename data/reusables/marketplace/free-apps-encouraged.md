Free apps are encouraged in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} and are a great way to offer open source services. If you list a paid version of your app outside of {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} then, after a free listing of your app in the marketplace meets the [requirements for paid apps](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app#requirements-for-paid-apps), you must offer at least one paid plan for the app in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

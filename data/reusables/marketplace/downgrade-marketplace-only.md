Canceling an app or downgrading an app to free does not affect your [other paid subscriptions](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github) on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. If you want to cease all of your paid subscriptions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you must downgrade each paid subscription separately.

{% note %}

**Note**: When environments are used in workflows or in OIDC policies, we recommend adding protection rules to the environment for additional security. For example, you can configure deployment rules on an environment to restrict which branches and tags can deploy to the environment or access environment secrets. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/managing-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules)."

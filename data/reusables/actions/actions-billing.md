{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage is free for public repositories that use standard {% data variables.product.github %}-hosted runners. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories). For private and internal repositories, each {% data variables.product.github %} account receives a quota of free minutes and storage for use with {% data variables.product.github %}-hosted or self-hosted runners. The quota size depends on the account's plan. Any usage beyond the included amounts is billed to your account.

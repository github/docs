### Using self-hosted runners on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}

When using setup actions (such as `actions/setup-LANGUAGE`) on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} with self-hosted runners, you might need to set up the tools cache on runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/setting-up-the-tool-cache-on-self-hosted-runners-without-internet-access)."

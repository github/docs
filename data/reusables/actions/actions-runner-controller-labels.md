You cannot use additional labels to target runners created by ARC. You can only use the installation name of the runner scale set that you specified during the installation or by defining the value of the `runnerScaleSetName` field in your [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/charts/gha-runner-scale-set/values.yaml) file. These are used as the 'single label' to use as your `runs-on` target.

If your repository uses {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to perform required checks {% ifversion repo-rules-required-workflows %}or if you require workflows via organization rulesets {% endif %}on pull requests in your repository, you need to update the workflows to include the `merge_group` event as an additional trigger. Otherwise, status checks will not be triggered when you add a pull request to a merge queue. The merge will fail as the required status check will not be reported. The `merge_group` event is separate from the `pull_request` and `push` events.

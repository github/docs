Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. It can be a string or array of strings. If a job fails or is skipped, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional expression that causes the job to continue. If a run contains a series of jobs that need each other, a failure or skip applies to all jobs in the dependency chain from the point of failure or skip onwards. If you would like a job to run even if a job it is dependent on did not succeed, use the `always()` conditional expression in `jobs.<job_id>.if`.

### Example: Requiring successful dependent jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

In this example, `job1` must complete successfully before `job2` begins, and `job3` waits for both `job1` and `job2` to complete.

The jobs in this example run sequentially:

1. `job1`
1. `job2`
1. `job3`

### Example: Not requiring successful dependent jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    if: {% raw %}${{ always() }}{% endraw %}
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

In this example, `job3` uses the `always()` conditional expression so that it always runs after `job1` and `job2` have completed, regardless of whether they were successful. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#status-check-functions)."

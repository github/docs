You can use contexts to create matrices. For more information about contexts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts)."

For example, the following workflow triggers on the `repository_dispatch` event and uses information from the event payload to build the matrix. When a repository dispatch event is created with a payload like the one below, the matrix `version` variable will have a value of `[12, 14, 16]`. For more information about the `repository_dispatch` trigger, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch)."

```json
{
  "event_type": "test",
  "client_payload": {
    "versions": [12, 14, 16]
  }
}
```

```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - test
 
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: {% raw %}${{ github.event.client_payload.versions }}{% endraw %}
    steps:
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-setup-node %}
        with:
          node-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.version }}{% endraw %}
```

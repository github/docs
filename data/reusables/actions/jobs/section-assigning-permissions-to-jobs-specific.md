For a specific job, you can use `jobs.<job_id>.permissions` to modify the default permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)."

By specifying the permission within a job definition, you can configure a different set of permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for each job, if required. Alternatively, you can specify the permissions for all jobs in the workflow. For information on defining permissions at the workflow level, see [`permissions`](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions).

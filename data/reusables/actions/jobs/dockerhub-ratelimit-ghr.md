> [!NOTE]
> Docker Hub normally imposes rate limits on both push and pull operations which will affect jobs on self-hosted runners. However, {% data variables.product.github %}-hosted runners are not subject to these limits based on an agreement between {% data variables.product.github %} and Docker.

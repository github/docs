Use `jobs.<job_id>` to give your job a unique identifier. The key `job_id` is a string and its value is a map of the job's configuration data. You must replace `<job_id>` with a string that is unique to the `jobs` object. The `<job_id>` must start with a letter or `_` and contain only alphanumeric characters, `-`, or `_`.

### Example: Creating jobs

In this example, two jobs have been created, and their `job_id` values are `my_first_job` and `my_second_job`.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
```

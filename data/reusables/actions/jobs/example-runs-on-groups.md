In this example, Ubuntu runners have been added to a group called `ubuntu-runners`. The `runs-on` key sends the job to any available runner in the `ubuntu-runners` group:

```yaml
name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: 
      group: ubuntu-runners
    steps:
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-setup-node %}
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
```

This guide shows you how to create a workflow that publishes Java packages to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} and the Maven Central Repository. With a single workflow, you can publish packages to a single repository or to multiple repositories.

>[!WARNING] The examples used in this guide refer to the Legacy OSSRH service. See [Publishing](https://central.sonatype.org/faq/what-is-different-between-central-portal-and-legacy-ossrh/#publishing) in the Maven Central Repository documentation.

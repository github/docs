If you plan to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for the users of your instance, more resources are required.

* {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} - increase CPU and memory by 25%
* {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} - increase CPU and memory by 15%

These adjustments should be applied to the base requirements for each user tier.

For more information about these requirements, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server#review-hardware-considerations)."

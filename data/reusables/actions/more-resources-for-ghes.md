If you plan to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for the users of your instance, more resources are required.

* {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} - increase both CPU and memory by at least 25%
* {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} - increase both CPU and memory by at least 25%

These adjustments should be applied to the base requirements for each user tier. We recommend monitoring all changes to your resources, as further increases may be needed.

For more information about these requirements, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server#review-hardware-considerations).

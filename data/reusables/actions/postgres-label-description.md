The workflow configures a service container with the label `postgres`. All services must run in a container, so each service requires that you specify the container `image`. This example uses the `postgres` container image, provides the default PostgreSQL password, and includes health check options to make sure the service is running. For more information, see the [postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) on Docker Hub.

The fully-formed ref of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow run. For workflows triggered by `push`, this is the branch or tag ref that was pushed. For workflows triggered by `pull_request`, this is the pull request merge branch. For workflows triggered by `release`, this is the release tag created. For other triggers, this is the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow run. This is only set if a branch or tag is available for the event type. The ref given is fully-formed, meaning that for branches the format is `refs/heads/<branch_name>`, for pull requests it is `refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge`, and for tags it is `refs/tags/<tag_name>`. For example, `refs/heads/feature-branch-1`.

You can specify a single event or multiple events. For example, a workflow with the following `on` value will run when a push is made to any branch in the repository or when someone forks the repository:

```yaml
on: [push, fork]
```

If you specify multiple events, only one of those events needs to occur to trigger your workflow. If multiple triggering events for your workflow occur at the same time, multiple workflow runs will be triggered.

If the image's container registry requires authentication to pull the image, you can use `jobs.<job_id>.container.credentials` to set a `map` of the `username` and `password`. The credentials are the same values that you would provide to the [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) command.

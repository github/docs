When a workflow job that references an environment runs, it creates a deployment object with the `environment` property set to the name of your environment. As the workflow progresses, it also creates deployment status objects with the `environment` property set to the name of your environment, the `environment_url` property set to the URL for environment (if specified in the workflow), and the `state` property set to the status of the job.

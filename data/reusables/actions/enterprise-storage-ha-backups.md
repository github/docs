{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses external storage to store workflow artifacts and logs. This data is stored on your external provider, such as Azure blob storage, Amazon S3,{% ifversion actions-ghes-gcp-storage %} Google Cloud Storage,{% endif %} or MinIO. As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} backups and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} high availability configurations do not provide protection for the data stored on this external storage, and instead rely on the data protection and replication provided by the external storage provider, such as Azure{% ifversion actions-ghes-gcp-storage %}, Google Cloud,{% endif %} or AWS.

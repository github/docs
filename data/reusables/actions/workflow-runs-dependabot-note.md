Workflow runs triggered by {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} pull requests run as if they are from a forked repository, and therefore use a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN`. These workflow runs cannot access any secrets. For information about strategies to keep these workflows secure, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions)."

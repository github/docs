{% ifversion internal-actions %}
To share actions across your enterprise without publishing the actions publicly, you can store the actions in an internal repository, then configure the repository to allow access to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows in other repositories owned by the same organization or by any organization in the enterprise. For more information, see "[Sharing actions and workflows with your enterprise](/actions/creating-actions/sharing-actions-and-workflows-with-your-enterprise)."

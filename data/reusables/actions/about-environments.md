Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`. When a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow deploys to an environment, the environment is displayed on the main page of the repository. You can use environments to require approval for a job to proceed, restrict which branches can trigger a workflow{% ifversion actions-custom-deployment-protection-rules-beta %}, gate deployments with custom deployment protection rules{% endif %}, or limit access to secrets. For more information about creating environments, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/managing-environments-for-deployment)."

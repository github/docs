When using the `workflow_run` event, you can specify what branches the triggering workflow must run on in order to trigger your workflow.

The `branches` and `branches-ignore` filters accept glob patterns that use characters like `*`, `**`, `+`, `?`, `!` and others to match more than one branch name. If a name contains any of these characters and you want a literal match, you need to _escape_ each of these special characters with `\`. For more information about glob patterns, see the "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet)."

For example, a workflow with the following trigger will only run when the workflow named `Build` runs on a branch whose name starts with `releases/`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
```

A workflow with the following trigger will only run when the workflow named `Build` runs on a branch that is not named `canary`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches-ignore:
      - "canary"
```

You cannot use both the `branches` and `branches-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow. If you want to both include and exclude branch patterns for a single event, use the `branches` filter along with the `!` character to indicate which branches should be excluded.

The order that you define patterns matters.

- A matching negative pattern (prefixed with `!`) after a positive match will exclude the branch.
- A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the branch again.

For example, a workflow with the following trigger will run when the workflow named `Build` runs on a branch that is named `releases/10` or `releases/beta/mona` but will not `releases/10-alpha`, `releases/beta/3-alpha`, or `main`.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
      - '!releases/**-alpha'
```

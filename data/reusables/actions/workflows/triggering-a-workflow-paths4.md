You cannot use `paths` and `paths-ignore` to filter the same event in a single workflow. If you want to both include and exclude path patterns for a single event, use the `paths` filter prefixed with the `!` character to indicate which paths should be excluded.

If you define a path with the `!` character, you must also define at least one path without the `!` character. If you only want to exclude paths, use `paths-ignore` instead.

The order that you define `paths` patterns matters:

* A matching negative pattern (prefixed with `!`) after a positive match will exclude the path.
* A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the path again.

This example runs anytime the `push` event includes a file in the `sub-project` directory or its subdirectories, unless the file is in the `sub-project/docs` directory. For example, a push that changed `sub-project/index.js` or `sub-project/src/index.js` will trigger a workflow run, but a push changing only `sub-project/docs/readme.md` will not.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'sub-project/**'
      - '!sub-project/docs/**'
```

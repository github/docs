The patterns defined in `branches` and `tags` are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a `push` event to:

* A branch named `main` (`refs/heads/main`)
* A branch named `mona/octocat` (`refs/heads/mona/octocat`)
* A branch whose name starts with `releases/`, like `releases/10` (`refs/heads/releases/10`)
* A tag named `v2` (`refs/tags/v2`)
* A tag whose name starts with `v1.`, like `v1.9.1` (`refs/tags/v1.9.1`)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches:
      - main
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
      - v2
      - v1.*
```

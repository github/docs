When using the `push` event, you can configure a workflow to run on specific branches or tags.

Use the `branches` filter when you want to include branch name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude branch names patterns. Use the `branches-ignore` filter when you only want to exclude branch name patterns. You cannot use both the `branches` and `branches-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow.

Use the `tags` filter when you want to include tag name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude tag names patterns. Use the `tags-ignore` filter when you only want to exclude tag name patterns. You cannot use both the `tags` and `tags-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow.

If you define only `tags`/`tags-ignore` or only `branches`/`branches-ignore`, the workflow won't run for events affecting the undefined Git ref. If you define neither  `tags`/`tags-ignore` or `branches`/`branches-ignore`, the workflow will run for events affecting either branches or tags. If you define both `branches`/`branches-ignore` and [`paths`/`paths-ignore`](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore), the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

The `branches`, `branches-ignore`, `tags`, and `tags-ignore` keywords accept glob patterns that use characters like `*`, `**`, `+`, `?`, `!` and others to match more than one branch or tag name. If a name contains any of these characters and you want a literal match, you need to _escape_ each of these special characters with `\`. For more information about glob patterns, see the "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet)."

#### Example: Including branches and tags

The patterns defined in `branches` and `tags` are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a `push` event to:

- A branch named `main` (`refs/heads/main`)
- A branch named `mona/octocat` (`refs/heads/mona/octocat`)
- A branch whose name starts with `releases/`, like `releases/10` (`refs/heads/releases/10`)
- A tag named `v2` (`refs/tags/v2`)
- A tag whose name starts with `v1.`, like `v1.9.1` (`refs/tags/v1.9.1`)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches:    
      - main
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:        
      - v2
      - v1.*
```

#### Example: Excluding branches and tags

When a pattern matches the `branches-ignore` or `tags-ignore` pattern, the workflow will not run. The patterns defined in `branches` and `tags` are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a `push` event, unless the `push` event is to:

- A branch named `mona/octocat` (`refs/heads/mona/octocat`)
- A branch whose name matches `releases/**-alpha`, like `releases/beta/3-alpha` (`refs/heads/releases/beta/3-alpha`)
- A tag named `v2` (`refs/tags/v2`)
- A tag whose name starts with `v1.`, like `v1.9` (`refs/tags/v1.9`)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches-ignore:    
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**-alpha'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags-ignore:        
      - v2
      - v1.*
```

#### Example: Including and excluding branches and tags

You can't use `branches` and `branches-ignore` to filter the same event in a single workflow. Similarly, you can't use `tags` and `tags-ignore` to filter the same event in a single workflow. If you want to both include and exclude branch or tag patterns for a single event, use the `branches` or `tags` filter along with the `!` character to indicate which branches or tags should be excluded.

If you define a branch with the `!` character, you must also define at least one branch without the `!` character. If you only want to exclude branches, use `branches-ignore` instead. Similarly, if you define a tag with the `!` character, you must also define at least one tag without the `!` character. If you only want to exclude tags, use `tags-ignore` instead.

The order that you define patterns matters.

- A matching negative pattern (prefixed with `!`) after a positive match will exclude the Git ref.
- A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the Git ref again.

The following workflow will run on pushes to `releases/10` or `releases/beta/mona`, but not on `releases/10-alpha` or `releases/beta/3-alpha` because the negative pattern `!releases/**-alpha` follows the positive pattern.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
      - '!releases/**-alpha'
```

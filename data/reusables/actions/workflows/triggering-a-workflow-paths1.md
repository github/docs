When using the `push` and `pull_request` events, you can configure a workflow to run based on what file paths are changed. Path filters are not evaluated for pushes of tags.

Use the `paths` filter when you want to include file path patterns or when you want to both include and exclude file path patterns. Use the `paths-ignore` filter when you only want to exclude file path patterns. You cannot use both the `paths` and `paths-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow. If you want to both include and exclude path patterns for a single event, use the `paths` filter prefixed with the `!` character to indicate which paths should be excluded.

> [!NOTE]
> The order that you define `paths` patterns matters:
>
> * A matching negative pattern (prefixed with `!`) after a positive match will exclude the path.
> * A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the path again.

If you define both `branches`/`branches-ignore` and `paths`/`paths-ignore`, the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

The `paths` and `paths-ignore` keywords accept glob patterns that use the `*` and `**` wildcard characters to match more than one path name. For more information, see the "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet)."

To automatically trigger a workflow, use `on` to define which events can cause the workflow to run. For a list of available events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)."

You can define single or multiple events that can trigger a workflow, or set a time schedule. You can also restrict the execution of a workflow to only occur for specific files, tags, or branch changes. These options are described in the following sections.

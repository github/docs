>[!NOTE]
> You can build Docker container, JavaScript, and composite actions. Actions require a metadata file to define the inputs, outputs, and runs configuration for your action. Action metadata files use YAML syntax, and the metadata filename must be either `action.yml` or `action.yaml`. The preferred format is `action.yml`.

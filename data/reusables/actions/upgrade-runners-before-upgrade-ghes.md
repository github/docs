If you use ephemeral runners and have disabled automatic updates, before you upgrade {% data variables.product.product_location %}, you should first upgrade your self-hosted runners to the version of the runner application that your upgraded instance will run. Upgrading {% data variables.product.product_location %} before you upgrade ephemeral runners may result in your runners going offline. For more information, see "[Upgrading {% data variables.product.product_name %}](/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

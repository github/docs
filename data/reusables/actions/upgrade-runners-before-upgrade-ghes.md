If you use ephemeral runners and have disabled automatic updates, before you upgrade {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, you should first upgrade your self-hosted runners to the version of the runner application that your upgraded instance will run. Upgrading {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} before you upgrade ephemeral runners may result in your runners going offline. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/upgrading-your-instance/preparing-to-upgrade/overview-of-the-upgrade-process)."

## Artifacts from deleted workflow runs

When a workflow run is deleted all artifacts associated with the run are also deleted from storage. You can delete a workflow run using the GitHub Actions UI, the REST API, or using the GitHub CLI, see: [AUTOTITLE](/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/deleting-a-workflow-run), [Delete a workflow run](/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#delete-a-workflow-run), or [gh run delete](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_run_delete).

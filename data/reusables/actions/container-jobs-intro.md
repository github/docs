Configuring jobs to run in a container simplifies networking configurations between the job and the service containers. Docker containers on the same user-defined bridge network expose all ports to each other, so you don't need to map any of the service container ports to the Docker host. You can access the service container from the job container using the label you configure in the workflow.

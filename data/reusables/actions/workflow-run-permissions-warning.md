> [!WARNING]
> Workflows triggered by the `workflow_run` event are privileged (i.e. they share the same cache of the main branch with other privileged workflow triggers, may have repository write access and access to referenced secrets). You should make sure that you do not check out, build, or run untrusted code from the pull request or other untrusted sources with this event. The workflow shares the same cache as the other privileged workflows running in the context of the main branch. Running untrusted code on this trigger may lead to cache poisoning. For more information, see [Understanding the risks of untrusted code checkout](/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risks-of-untrusted-code-checkout) in the Security Hardening for GitHub Actions documentation and [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests) on the GitHub Security Lab website.

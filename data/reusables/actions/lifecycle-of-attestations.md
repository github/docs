Attestations are only meaningful when they are linked to artifacts that people consume. To keep your attestations relevant and manageable, you should delete attestations that are no longer needed, such as:

* Attestations created by accident
* Attestations linked to artifacts that no longer exist
* Attestations linked to artifacts that consumers should no longer trust

When consumers have a verification process in place, deleting an attestation can prevent the associated artifact from being used. Consider setting up automations to ensure that attestations are deleted when the associated artifact is removed from an external service (for example, an image is deleted from a container registry).

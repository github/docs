The workflow configures a service container with the label `redis`. All services must run in a container, so each service requires that you specify the container `image`. This example uses the `redis` container image, and includes health check options to make sure the service is running. Append a tag to the image name to specify a version, e.g. `redis:6`. For more information, see the [redis image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) on Docker Hub.

To ensure workflows use their intended actions and to block the potential for abuse, once an action on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} is used for the first time, the namespace associated with that action is retired in your enterprise. This blocks users from creating an organization and repository in your enterprise that match the action's namespace on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

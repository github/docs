{% note %}

**Note:** If your workflows use Docker container actions, job containers, or service containers, then you must use a Linux runner:

* If you are using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners, you must use an Ubuntu runner.
* If you are using self-hosted runners, you must use a Linux machine as your runner and Docker must be installed.

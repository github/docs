You can configure a runner group to run either selected workflows or all workflows. For example, you might use this setting to protect secrets that are stored on runners or to standardize deployment workflows by restricting a runner group to run only a specific reusable workflow. This setting cannot be overridden if you are configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.

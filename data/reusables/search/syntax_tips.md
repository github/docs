  - This article contains example searches on the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.com website, but you can use the same search filters on {% data variables.product.product_location_enterprise %}.{% endif %}
  - For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see "[Understanding the search syntax](/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax)".
  - Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label "In progress," you'd search for `label:"in progress"`. Search is not case sensitive.

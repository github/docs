>[!WARNING] Your Apache Maven package must follow the naming convention, and therefore the `artifactId` field should only contain lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens. For more information, see [Naming convention of Maven coordinates](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html) in the maven.apache.org documentation. If you use upercase letters in the artifact name, you'll get a _422 Unprocessable Entity_ response.

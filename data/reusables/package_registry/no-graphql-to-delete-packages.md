You cannot use the {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} GraphQL API with registries that support granular permissions. For the registries that **only** support repository-scoped permissions, and can be used with the GraphQL API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

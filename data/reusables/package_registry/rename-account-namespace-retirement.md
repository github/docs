If the account namespace includes any packages or container images stored in a {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} registry, {% data variables.product.company_short %} transfers the packages and container images to the new namespace. By renaming your account, you may break projects that depend on these packages.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If the namespace includes any container images that are public and have more than 5,000 downloads, the full former name of these container images (`OLD-NAMESPACE/IMAGE-NAME`) is permanently retired when you rename the account to ensure the container image name cannot be reused in the future.{% endif %}

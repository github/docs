> We **strongly recommend** using a TOTP application for two-factor authentication instead of SMS, and security keys as backup methods instead of SMS. {% data variables.product.github %} doesn't support sending SMS messages to phones in every country. Before configuring authentication via text message, review the list of countries where {% data variables.product.github %} supports authentication via SMS.

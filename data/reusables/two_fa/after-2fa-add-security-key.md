After you configure 2FA, using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) mobile app{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, or via text message{% endif %}, you can add a security key, like a FIDO2 hardware security key, Apple Touch ID or Windows Hello. The technology that enables authentication with a security key is called WebAuthn. WebAuthn is the successor to U2F and works in all modern browsers. For more information, see "[WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/)" and "[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#search=webauthn)."

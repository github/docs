If the root site administrator's {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} login is locked, someone with administrative SSH access must unlock the login. To immediately unlock access to the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} by the root site administrator, use the `ghe-reactivate-admin-login` command via the administrative shell. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-reactivate-admin-login) and [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh).

If you forgot the root site administrator's password to access the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}, you can set a new password with the `ghe-set-password` command via the administrative shell. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-set-password) and [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh).

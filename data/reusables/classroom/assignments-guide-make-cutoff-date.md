Optionally, to make the deadline a cutoff date, select **This is a cutoff date**. If you use a cutoff date, students will lose write access to their assignment repositories after the cutoff date has passed unless they receive an extension. For more information on extending assignment deadlines, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/extending-an-assignments-deadline-for-an-individual-or-group)."

When a student accepts an assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} automatically creates a new repository for the student. The repositories can be empty, or you can create the repositories from a template repository with starter code, documentation, tests, and other resources. Each assignment repository belongs to your organization account on {% data variables.product.github %}.

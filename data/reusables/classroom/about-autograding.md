You can use autograding to automatically check a student's work for an assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. You configure tests for an assignment, and the tests run immediately every time a student pushes to an assignment repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. The student can view the test results, make changes, and push to see new results.

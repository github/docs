When a student accepts a group assignment, the student can create a new team or join an existing team. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} saves the teams for an assignment as a set. You can name the set of teams for a specific assignment when you create the assignment, and you can reuse that set of teams for a later assignment.

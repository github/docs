You can link up to twenty-five repositories to your organization or user-owned {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. Linking repositories makes it easier to add issues and pull requests from those repositories to your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} using **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" %} Add cards** or from the issue or pull requests sidebar.

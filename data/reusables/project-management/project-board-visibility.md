By default, user-owned and organization-wide {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %} are private and only visible to people with read, write, or admin permissions to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. A public {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} is visible to anyone with the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}'s URL. Repository-level {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %} share the visibility of their repository. That is, a private repository will have a private project, and this visibility cannot be changed.

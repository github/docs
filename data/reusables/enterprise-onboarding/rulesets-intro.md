You can create rulesets to control how users can interact with code in repositories across your enterprise. You can:

* Create a **branch or tag ruleset** to control things like who can push commits to a certain branch, how commits must be formatted, or who can delete or rename a tag.
* Create a **push ruleset** to block pushes to a private or internal repository and the repository's entire fork network. Push rulesets allow you to block pushes based on file extensions, file path lengths, file and folder paths, and file sizes.

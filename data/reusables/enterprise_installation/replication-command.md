1. To start replication of the datastores, use the `ghe-repl-start` command.

   ```shell
   ghe-repl-start
   ```

   {% warning %}

   **Warning:** `ghe-repl-start` causes a brief outage on the primary server, during which users may see internal server errors. To provide a friendlier message, run `ghe-maintenance -s` on the primary node before running `ghe-repl-start` on the replica node to put the appliance in maintenance mode. Once replication starts, disable maintenance mode with `ghe-maintenance -u`. Git replication will not progress while the primary node is in maintenance mode.

   {% endwarning %}

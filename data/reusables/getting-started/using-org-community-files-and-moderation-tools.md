You can create default community health files, such as a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, or even issue and pull request templates, for your organization. These default files will be used for any repository owned by your organization that does not contain its own file of that type. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} offers multiple tools for moderating and managing your community. For more information, see "[Tools for moderating your community](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-management-and-moderation#tools-for-moderating-your-community)."

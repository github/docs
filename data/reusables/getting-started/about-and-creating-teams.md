Teams are groups of organization members that you can create to reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions. Organization members can send notifications to a team or request reviews, and teams can be visible or secret. For more information, see "[About teams](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

You can create independent teams or have multiple levels of nested teams to reflect your group or company's hierarchy. For more information, see "[Creating a team](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team)."

Repository administrators can enable protections on a branch. If you're working on a branch that's protected, you won't be able to delete or force push to the branch. Repository administrators can enable other protected branch settings to enforce specific workflows before a branch can be merged. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)."

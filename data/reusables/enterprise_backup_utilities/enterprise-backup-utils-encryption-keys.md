After restoration of a backup created using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %} and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information about using an existing backup, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)."

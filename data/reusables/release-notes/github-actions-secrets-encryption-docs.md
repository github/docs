"[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service.

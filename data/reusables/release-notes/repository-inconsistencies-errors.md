Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.

An upgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. The performance of this upgrade has been improved in 3.6.14 and 3.7.11, however if you have tens of thousands of recently deleted repositories the upgrade could still take multiple hours. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have tens of thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories.

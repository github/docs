An upgrade to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories.

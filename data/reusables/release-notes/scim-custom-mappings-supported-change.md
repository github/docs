For participants in the {% data variables.release-phases.private_preview %} of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, custom mappings for SAML user attributes are now supported. Custom mappings allow the use of a value other than `NameID` as the unique identifying claim during SAML authentication. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-user-provisioning-with-scim-for-your-enterprise#about-identities-and-claims)."

After restoration of a backup created using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %} {% ifversion ghes = 3.7 %}3.7.0{% elsif ghes = 3.8 %}3.7.0 or 3.8.0{% elsif ghes = 3.9 %}3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0{% endif %}, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %} {% ifversion ghes = 3.7 %}3.7.1{% elsif ghes = 3.8 %}3.8.1{% elsif ghes = 3.9 %}3.9.1{% endif %} and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)."

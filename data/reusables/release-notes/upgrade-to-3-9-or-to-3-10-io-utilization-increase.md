After an administrator upgrades from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.

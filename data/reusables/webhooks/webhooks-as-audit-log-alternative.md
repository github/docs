Webhooks might be a good alternative to the audit log or API polling for certain use cases. Webhooks are a way for {% data variables.product.company_short %} to notify your server when specific events occur for a repository, organization, or enterprise. Compared to the API or searching the audit log, webhooks can be more efficient if you just want to learn and possibly log when certain events occur on your enterprise, organization, or repository. See "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks)."

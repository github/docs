The {% data variables.product.product_name %} REST API is versioned. The API version name is based on the date when the API version was released. For example, the API version `{{ initialRestVersioningReleaseDate }}` was released on {{ initialRestVersioningReleaseDateLong }}.

Any breaking changes will be released in a new API version. Breaking changes are changes that can potentially break an integration. Breaking changes include:

* removing an entire operation
* removing or renaming a parameter
* removing or renaming a response field
* adding a new required parameter
* making a previously optional parameter required
* changing the type of a parameter or response field
* removing enum values
* adding a new validation rule to an existing parameter
* changing authentication or authorization requirements

Any additive (non-breaking) changes will be available in all supported API versions. Additive changes are changes that should not break an integration. Additive changes include:

* adding an operation
* adding an optional parameter
* adding an optional request header
* adding a response field
* adding a response header
* adding enum values

When a new REST API version is released, the previous API version will be supported for at least 24 more months following the release of the new API version.

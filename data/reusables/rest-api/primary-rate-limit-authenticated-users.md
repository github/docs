You can use a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} to make API requests. Additionally, you can authorize a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}, which can then make API requests on your behalf.

  All of these requests count towards your personal rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Requests made on your behalf by a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} that is owned by a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization have a higher rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour. Similarly, requests made on your behalf by a {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} that is owned or approved by a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization have a higher rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour if you are a member of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization. However, requests made by a higher-limit app reduce the remaining budget available for lower-limit authentication methods. For example, if an app with a 15,000 request limit makes 10,000 requests on your behalf, you will have exhausted the 5,000 request budget for your {% data variables.product.pat_generic_plural %}, even though the app has 5,000 requests remaining.{% endif %}

For example, the following [Go Dependency Submission](https://github.com/actions/go-dependency-submission) workflow calculates the dependencies for a Go build-target (a Go file with a `main` function) and submits the list to the {% data variables.dependency-submission-api.name %}.

```yaml
name: Go Dependency Submission
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# The API requires write permission on the repository to submit dependencies
permissions:
  contents: write

# Environment variables to configure Go and Go modules. Customize as necessary
env:
  GOPROXY: '' # A Go Proxy server to be used
  GOPRIVATE: '' # A list of modules are considered private and not requested from GOPROXY
jobs:
  go-action-detection:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout Repository'
        uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}

      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-setup-go %}
        with:
          go-version: ">=1.18.0"

      - name: Run snapshot action
        uses: actions/go-dependency-submission@v1
        with:
            # Required: Define the repo path to the go.mod file used by the
            # build target
            go-mod-path: go-example/go.mod
            #
            # Optional. Define the repo path of a build target,
            # a file with a `main()` function.
            # If undefined, this action will collect all dependencies
            # used by all build targets for the module. This may
            # include Go dependencies used by tests and tooling.
            go-build-target: go-example/cmd/octocat.go
```

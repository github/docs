{% data reusables.audit_log.audit-log-search-list-info-about-action %}

Note that you cannot search for entries using text. You can, however, construct search queries using a variety of filters. Many operators used when querying the log, such as `-`, `>`, or `<`, match the same format as searching across {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

### Search based on the user

The `actor` qualifier can scope events based on who performed the action. For example:

* `actor:octocat` finds all events performed by `octocat`.
* `actor:octocat actor:hubot` finds all events performed by `octocat` or `hubot`.
* `-actor:hubot` excludes all events performed by `hubot`.

Note that you can only use a {% data variables.product.product_name %} username, not an individual's real name.

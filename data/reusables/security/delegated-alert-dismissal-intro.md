Delegated alert dismissal lets you restrict which users can directly dismiss an alert. When enabled, users attempting to dismiss an alert will instead create a request for dismissal.
When this happens, security managers and organization owners will be notified via email so they can review the request and approve it or deny it. The alert will only be dismissed if the dismissal request is approved; otherwise, the alert will remain open.

When you enable this feature, only security managers and organization owners will be able to approve or deny dismissal requests for alerts.
This might create friction and you should ensure to have sufficient coverage in your security managers team before you start.

In addition, dismissal request emails are sent to all organization owners and security managers. Be sure to review these lists periodically to ensure that these are the correct people to take action on these requests.

To open, view, and comment on support tickets associated with an enterprise account, you must have support entitlements for the enterprise. Enterprise owners and billing managers automatically have a support entitlement, and enterprise owners can add support entitlements to enterprise members. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-support-entitlements-for-your-enterprise)."

{% note %}

**Note:** Any organization member can create tickets associated with an individual organization that is owned by an enterprise account. Support entitlements are only required to create tickets associated with the enterprise account itself.

To select an Azure subscription, you must have owner permissions to the subscription. If the default tenant does not have the right permissions, you may need to specify a different tenant ID. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/azure-subscriptions) and [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) in Microsoft Docs.

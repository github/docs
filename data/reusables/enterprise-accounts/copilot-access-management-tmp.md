1. Go to the access management page for your enterprise. Temporarily, the location of this page varies depending on whether your enterprise has been migrated to the new UI for direct {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licensing.

   * First, try `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR-ENTERPRISE/enterprise_licensing/copilot`, replacing YOUR-ENTERPRISE with your enterprise's slug.
   * If you receive a 404 error, go to `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR-ENTERPRISE/settings/copilot`.

   >[!TIP] If you use {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency %}, replace `github.com` with `{% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_domain %}`.

Passkeys allow you to sign in securely to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} in your browser, without having to input your password.

If you use two-factor authentication (2FA), passkeys satisfy both password and 2FA requirements, so you can complete your sign in with a single step. If you don't use 2FA, using a passkey will skip the requirement to verify a new device via email. You can also use passkeys for sudo mode and resetting your password.

Optionally, you can add a passkey to your account. Passkeys are similar to security keys and satisfy both password and 2FA requirements, allowing you to sign in with a single step. However, to reduce the risk of account lockouts, you should also configure a fallback 2FA method, such as a TOTP mobile app or SMS-based authentication. If you have already set up a security key for 2FA that is passkey-eligible, you may be prompted to upgrade it to a passkey during registration.

1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %}" section, click **Manage seats**.

   ![Screenshot of the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %}" section. A button, labeled "Manage seats", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-business-manage-seats.png)

1. Click **Add teams**.
1. In the dialog, select the teams you want to add, review how your bill will be affected, then click **Add teams**.

You can add or remove users from a team at any time. After you remove a user from a team, the user's license and access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will be removed the next time the user attempts to authenticate. This can take **up to 30 minutes**.

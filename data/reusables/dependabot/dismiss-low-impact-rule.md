The `Dismiss low impact issues for development-scoped dependencies` is a {% data variables.product.company_short %} preset rule. This rule auto-dismisses certain types of vulnerabilities that are found in npm dependencies used in development. The rule has been curated to reduce false positives and reduce alert fatigue. You cannot modify {% data variables.dependabot.github_presets %}. For more information about {% data variables.dependabot.github_presets %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-auto-triage-rules/using-github-preset-rules-to-prioritize-dependabot-alerts)."

By default all dependencies that are explicitly defined in a manifest are kept up to date by {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} version updates. In addition, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} security updates also update vulnerable dependencies that are defined in lock files. You can use `allow` and `ignore` to customize which dependencies to maintain. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} checks for all allowed dependencies and then filters out any ignored dependencies or versions. So a dependency that is matched by both an `allow` and an `ignore` will be ignored.

Using `directory`, `directories`, or a mixture of both, are all valid approaches. You should tailor your configuration to your requirements. We recommend you use `directories` when you want to apply the exact same configuration to multiple directories or group dependency updates across multiple directories, and `directory` when you want to apply a configuration to only one directory, or if you want each directory to have a different configuration.

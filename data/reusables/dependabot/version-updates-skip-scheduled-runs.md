Sometimes, due to a misconfiguration or an incompatible version, you might see that a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} run has failed. After 30 failed runs, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_version_updates %} will skip subsequent scheduled runs until you manually trigger a check for updates from the dependency graph, or you update the manifest file. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} will still run as usual.

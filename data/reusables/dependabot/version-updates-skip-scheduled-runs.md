Sometimes, due to a misconfiguration or an incompatible version, you might see that a {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} run has failed. After {% ifversion dependabot-updates-failure-15-skip-schedule %}15 {% elsif ghes < 3.13 %}30 {% endif %}failed runs, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_version_updates %} will skip subsequent scheduled runs until you manually trigger a check for updates from the dependency graph. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} will still run as usual.

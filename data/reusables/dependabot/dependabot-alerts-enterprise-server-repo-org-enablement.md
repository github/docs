Enterprise owners must configure the dependency graph and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for an enterprise.

Once {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} have been configured, repository administrators and organization owners can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for private and internal repositories in their "Code security and analysis" settings page. Public repositories are enabled by default. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-the-dependency-graph-for-your-enterprise)", "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)," and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-dependabot-alerts)."

Additionally, you can use {% data variables.dependabot.auto_triage_rules %} to manage your alerts at scale, so you can auto-dismiss or snooze alerts, and specify which alerts you want {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to open pull requests for. For information about the different types of auto-triage rules, and whether your repositories are eligible, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-auto-triage-rules/about-dependabot-auto-triage-rules)."

You can use `directories` instead of `directory` to apply the same configuration to a list of multiple directories. The `directory` or `directories` entries must be unique and cannot overlap with the `directory` or `directories` entries in blocks that have the same ecosystem and `target-branch`. You can have one block specifying multiple directories and another block with specifications for one directory only, but both keys can't be present in the same block.

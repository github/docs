**Note:** It's good practice to have automated tests and acceptance processes in place so that checks are carried out before the pull request is merged. This is particularly important if the suggested version to upgrade to contains additional functionality, or a change that breaks your project's code. For more information about continuous integration, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)."

{% note %}

**Note:** If you have configured group rules for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} in a `dependabot.yml` file, all available updates will be grouped according to the rules you've specified. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} will only group across those directories not configured in your `dependabot.yml` if the setting for grouped security updates at the organization or repository level is also enabled.

You can have more granular control over the access you grant to your {% ifversion org-custom-role-with-repo-permissions %}organization and repository's{% else %} organization's{% endif %} settings by creating custom organization roles. Organization roles are a way to grant an organization member the ability to administer certain subsets of settings without granting full administrative control of the organization and its repositories. For example, you could create a role that contains the "View organization audit log" permission.

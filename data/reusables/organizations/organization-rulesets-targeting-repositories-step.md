With your ruleset, you can choose to target all repositories in your organization, repositories in your organization that match a certain naming convention, {% ifversion repository-properties %}repositories in your organization that have custom properties, {% endif %}or a list of manually selected repositories in your organization.

{% ifversion repository-properties %}

For more information about custom properties, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization)."

{% endif %}

If a repository is targeted by a ruleset created at the organization level, only owners of the organization can edit the ruleset. However, people with admin access to the repository, or with a custom role including the "edit repository rules" permission, can create additional rulesets at the repository level. The rules in these rulesets will be aggregated with the rules defined at the organization level. The result is that creating a new ruleset can make the rules targeting a branch or tag more restrictive, but never less restrictive. For more information on creating rulesets, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)."

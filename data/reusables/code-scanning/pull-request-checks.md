When you enable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on pull requests, the check fails only if one or more alerts of severity `error`, or security severity `critical` or `high` are detected. The check will succeed if alerts with lower severities or security severities are detected. For important codebases, you may want the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} check to fail if any alerts are detected, so that the alert must be fixed or dismissed before the code change is merged. For more information about severity levels, see "[About alert severity and security severity levels](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alert-severity-and-security-severity-levels)."

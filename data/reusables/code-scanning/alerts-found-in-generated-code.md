For compiled languages like Java, Kotlin, Go, C, C++, and C#, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analyzes all of the code which was built during the workflow run. To limit the amount of code being analyzed, build only the code which you wish to analyze by specifying your own build steps in a `run` block. You can combine specifying your own build steps with using the `paths` or `paths-ignore` filters on the `pull_request` and `push` events to ensure that your workflow only runs when specific code is changed. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore)."

For languages like JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, that {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analyzes without compiling the source code, you can specify additional configuration options to limit the amount of code to analyze.

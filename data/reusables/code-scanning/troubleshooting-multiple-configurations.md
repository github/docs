In some cases, your repository may use multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configurations. These configurations can generate duplicate alerts. Additionally, stale configurations that no longer run will display outdated alert statuses, and the stale alerts will stay open indefinitely. To avoid outdated alerts, you should remove stale {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configurations from a branch. For more information on multiple configurations and deleting stale configurations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alerts-from-multiple-configurations)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#removing-stale-configurations-and-alerts-from-a-branch)."

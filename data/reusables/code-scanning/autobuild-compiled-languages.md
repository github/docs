{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analyzes the {% data variables.code-scanning.compiled_languages %} source files in your repository that are built. You can use the `autobuild` action in the {% data variables.code-scanning.codeql_workflow %} to build your code. Alternatively, you can disable `autobuild` and instead specify explicit build commands to analyze only the files that are built by these custom commands.

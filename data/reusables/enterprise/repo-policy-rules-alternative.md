{% ifversion repo-policy-rules %}
We recommend creating a **repository policy** to govern the lifecycle of repositories in your enterprise, such as who can create or delete repositories. Repository policies give you flexibility over which users are affected and which organizations and repositories are targeted. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-repositories-in-your-enterprise/governing-how-people-use-repositories-in-your-enterprise).

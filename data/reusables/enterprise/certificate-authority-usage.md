Each certificate authority can only be uploaded to one account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If an SSH certificate authority has been added to an organization or enterprise account, you cannot add the same certificate authority to another organization or enterprise account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

If you add one certificate authority to an enterprise and another certificate authority to an organization in the enterprise, either certificate authority can be used to access the organization's repositories.

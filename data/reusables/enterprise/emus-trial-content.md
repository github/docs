### Enterprises with managed users

If you choose an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, you will also choose whether to create an enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} or in a specific data residency region on {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}.

However, there are some features that are not included in the trial.

To govern key events in the lifecycle of your repositories, such as who can create or delete repositories, you can create a repository policy. A repository policy is a collection of restrictions that gives you flexible control over which users are affected and which repositories are targeted.

In a repository policy, you can restrict:

* Which **visibilities** are permitted for new repositories and visibility changes.
* Who can **create** repositories.
* Who can **delete** repositories.
* Who can **transfer** repositories out of an organization.
* How people can **name** repositories.

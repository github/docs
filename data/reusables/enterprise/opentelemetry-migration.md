{% ifversion ghes-opentelemetry %}

OpenTelemetry metrics are the future foundation for monitoring, available from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.18 onward. This new monitoring stack provides enhanced observability and management capabilities compared to the legacy collectd system.

Collectd metrics continue to be gathered by default and remain fully supported in this release.

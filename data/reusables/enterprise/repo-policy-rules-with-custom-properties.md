We recommend using repository policies alongside **custom repository properties**. By adding custom properties to repositories, you will be able to flexibly target those repositories in a policy.

For example, you can add a property to mark repositories that contain production data or other sensitive information, then prevent anyone from making those repositories public.

To create and set custom properties, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).

Some of the available restrictions are duplicates of policies you may have set on the "Member privileges" page in your organization or enterprise settings.

Creating a repository policy does **not** override your existing "member privilege" policies. Instead, the policies are additive, so that the most restrictive version of a policy applies. This applies both to **member privilege policies** and to other **repository policies** that people have created at the enterprise or organization level.

Compared to member privilege policies, repository policies have several advantages:

* They offer more flexible targeting of organizations and repositories.
* They allow you to give certain actors the option to bypass the policies.

You can create a repository policy to govern who can create repositories in your organization, how new repositories must be named, and which visibilities are available. Compared to "member privilege" policies, repository policies give you more flexibility over which users are affected and which repositories are targeted. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/governing-how-people-use-repositories-in-your-organization).

You can use a repository policy to do things like:

* Ensure all new repositories use a certain naming convention, such as `kebab-case`.
* Prevent repository deletions except by organization admins.
* Allow public repositories to be created only in the "open source" organization in your enterprise.
* Prevent public repositories from being changed to private to avoid potential loss of metadata.

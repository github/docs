### Explaining code and suggesting improvements

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can help explain selected code by generating natural language descriptions of the code's functionality and purpose. This can be useful if you want to understand the code's behavior or for non-technical stakeholders who need to understand how the code works. For example, if you select a function or code block in the code editor, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can generate a natural language description of what the code does and how it fits into the overall system. This can include information such as the function's input and output parameters, its dependencies, and its purpose in the larger application.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can also suggest potential improvements to selected code, such as improved handling of errors and edge cases, or changes to the logical flow to make the code more readable.

By generating explanations and suggesting related documentation, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may help you to understand the selected code, leading to improved collaboration and more effective software development. However, it's important to note that the generated explanations and documentation may not always be accurate or complete, so you'll need to review, and occasionally correct, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}'s output.

Addtional contextual information can be automatically added to chat prompts from an optional `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file that the user can create. This additional information is not displayed in the chat, but if the instructions are sent to the model, the file is listed as a reference in the chat response. The user can disable this feature in the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} extension settings.

## Use cases for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} can provide coding assistance in a variety of scenarios.

### Generating unit test cases

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can help you write unit test cases by generating code snippets based on the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. This may help you write test cases without spending as much time on repetitive tasks. For example, if you are writing a test case for a specific function, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to suggest possible input parameters and expected output values based on the function's signature and body. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can also suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can also help you write test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types, helping you ensure your code is robust and resilient. However, it is important to note that generated test cases may not cover all possible scenarios, and manual testing and code review are still necessary to ensure the quality of the code.

### Explaining code and suggesting improvements

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can help explain selected code by generating natural language descriptions of the code's functionality and purpose. This can be useful if you want to understand the code's behavior or for non-technical stakeholders who need to understand how the code works. For example, if you select a function or code block in the code editor, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can generate a natural language description of what the code does and how it fits into the overall system. This can include information such as the function's input and output parameters, its dependencies, and its purpose in the larger application.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can also suggest potential improvements to selected code, such as improved handling of errors and edge cases, or changes to the logical flow to make the code more readable.

By generating explanations and suggesting related documentation, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may help you to understand the selected code, leading to improved collaboration and more effective software development. However, it's important to note that the generated explanations and documentation may not always be accurate or complete, so you'll need to review, and occasionally correct, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}'s output.

### Proposing code fixes

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can propose a fix for bugs in your code by suggesting code snippets and solutions based on the context of the error or issue. This can be useful if you are struggling to identify the root cause of a bug or you need guidance on the best way to fix it. For example, if your code produces an error message or warning, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can suggest possible fixes based on the error message, the code's syntax, and the surrounding code.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can suggest changes to variables, control structures, or function calls that might resolve the issue and generate code snippets that can be incorporated into the codebase. However, it's important to note that the suggested fixes may not always be optimal or complete, so you'll need to review and test the suggestions.

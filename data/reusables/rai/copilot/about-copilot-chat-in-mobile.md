### Input processing

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} system and sent to a large language model to get a response based on the context and prompt. User input can take the form of code snippets or plain language. The system is only intended to respond to coding-related questions.

### Language model analysis

The pre-processed prompt is then passed through the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt.

### Response generation

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt and the context provided to it. This response can take the form of generated code, code suggestions, or explanations of existing code.

### Output formatting

The response generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is formatted and presented to the user. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may use syntax highlighting, indentation, and other formatting features to add clarity to the generated response. Depending upon the type of question from the user, links to context that the model used when generating a response, such as source code files or documentation, may also be provided.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} is intended to provide you with the most relevant answer to your question. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. Users of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system to ensure they are accurate and appropriate.

For more information on the limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}, see "[Limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}](#limitations-of-copilot-chat-in-github-mobile)."

### Keep your prompts on topic

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is intended to address queries related to coding exclusively. Therefore, limiting the prompt to coding questions or tasks can enhance the model's output quality.

### Use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} as a tool, not a replacement

While {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can be a powerful tool for generating code, it is important to use it as a tool rather than a replacement for human programming. You should always review and test the code generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to ensure that it meets your requirements and is free of errors or security concerns.

### Use secure coding and code review practices

While {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can generate syntactically correct code, it may not always be secure. You should always follow best practices for secure coding, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords or SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as following code review best practices, to address {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}'s limitations.

### Provide feedback

### Stay up to date

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %} is a new technology and is likely to evolve over time. You should stay up to date with any updates or changes to the tool, as well as any new security risks or best practices that may emerge.

## Limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}

Depending on factors such as your codebase and input data, you may experience different levels of performance when using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}. The following information is designed to help you understand system limitations and key concepts about performance as they apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}.

### Limited scope

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} has been trained on a large body of code but still has a limited scope and may not be able to handle more complex code structures or obscure programming languages. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}'s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may be more challenging for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to provide assistance with. Additionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can only suggest code based on the context of the code being written, so it may not be able to identify larger design or architectural issues.

### Potential biases

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s training data is drawn from existing code repositories, which may contain biases and errors that can be perpetuated by the tool. Additionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may be biased towards certain programming languages or coding styles, which can lead to suboptimal or incomplete code suggestions.

### Security risks

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} generates code based on the context of the code being written, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly.

### Matches with public code

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is capable of generating new code, which it does in a probabilistic way. While the probability that it may produce code that matches code in the training set is low, a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} suggestion may contain some code snippets that match code in the training set. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} utilizes filters that block matches with public code on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories, but you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities.

### Inaccurate code

One of the limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is that it may generate code that appears to be valid but may not actually be semantically or syntactically correct or may not accurately reflect the intent of the developer. To mitigate the risk of inaccurate code, you should carefully review and test the generated code, particularly when dealing with critical or sensitive applications. You should also ensure that the generated code adheres to best practices and design patterns and fits within the overall architecture and style of the codebase.

### Inaccurate responses to non-coding topics

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is not designed to answer non-coding questions, and therefore its responses may not always be accurate or helpful in these contexts. If a user asks {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} a non-coding question, it may generate an answer that is irrelevant or nonsensical, or it may simply indicate that it is unable to provide a useful response.

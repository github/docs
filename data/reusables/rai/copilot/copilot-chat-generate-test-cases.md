### Generating unit test cases

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} can help you write unit test cases by generating code snippets based on the code open in the editor or the code snippet you highlight in the editor. This may help you write test cases without spending as much time on repetitive tasks. For example, if you are writing a test case for a specific function, you can use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} to suggest possible input parameters and expected output values based on the function's signature and body. {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} can also suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics.

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} can also help you write test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types, helping you ensure your code is robust and resilient. However, it is important to note that generated test cases may not cover all possible scenarios, and manual testing and code review are still necessary to ensure the quality of the code.

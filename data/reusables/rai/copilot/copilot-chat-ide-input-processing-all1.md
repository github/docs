### Input processing

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} system, combined with contextual information (for example, the name of the repository the user is currently viewing and the files the user has open), and sent to a large language model. User input can take the form of code snippets or plain language.

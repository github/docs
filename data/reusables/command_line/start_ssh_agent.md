1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.

    ```shell
    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    > Agent pid 59566
    ```

    Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running `sudo -s -H` before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use `exec ssh-agent bash` or `exec ssh-agent zsh` to run the ssh-agent.

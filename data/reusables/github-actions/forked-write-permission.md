You can use the `permissions` key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the **Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests** option in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} settings. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks)."

    If you pay for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} by invoice, you also have the option to pay at the start of your next billing cycle. This means you don't have to pay anything when setting up a sponsorship, and you will be charged the full amount on your next billing date. To schedule the sponsorship for your next billing cycle, click **Pay later**.

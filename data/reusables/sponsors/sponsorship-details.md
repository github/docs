You can sponsor anyone with a sponsored developer profile or sponsored organization profile on behalf of your personal account or an organization. You can select from a range of sponsorship tiers, whether for an individual profile or multiple profiles in bulk, and choose between one-time or monthly payment amounts and benefits, all determined by the sponsored account.

Your sponsorship will share your accountâ€™s existing billing date, payment method, and receipt.

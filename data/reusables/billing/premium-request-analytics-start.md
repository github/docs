User-level analytics have different access permissions depending on your role. 

* Enterprise owners and billing managers can see premium request analytics by user.
* Organization owners cannot view premium request analytics by user or use the `user` parameter in the API. To view user-level usage, these users can download a premium request usage report. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use#downloading-usage-reports).

If you created a trial of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} on or after August 1, 2024, you use usage-based billing to pay for your licenses. With usage-based billing, you pay for the number of licenses you use each month. You do not need to buy a predefined number of licenses in advance. See, "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/using-the-enhanced-billing-platform-for-enterprises/about-usage-based-billing-for-licenses)."

> [!IMPORTANT] If you currently pay for your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} licenses through a volume, subscription, or prepaid agreement, you will continue to be billed in this way until your agreement expires. At renewal, you have the option to switch to the metered billing model. See "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/using-the-enhanced-billing-platform-for-enterprises/getting-started-with-the-enhanced-billing-platform)."

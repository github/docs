To allocate metered spending to a cost center, you add repositories, organizations, or users to the cost center.

* For **metered** products like {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, cost centers are charged based on the **repositories or organizations** in the cost center, as this is where the usage takes place.
* For **metered license-based** products like {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, cost centers are charged based on the **users** in the cost center.

Cost centers only apply to metered usage, and do not work with volume or subscription billing.

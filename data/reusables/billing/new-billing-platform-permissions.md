The new billing platform is available to all enterprise accounts, and their organizations, created after June 2, 2024. Enterprises that participated in the {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} program also have access to the new billing platform.

Beginning in September 2024, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will migrate remaining enterprises to the new billing platform. Enterprises will receive a notice 30 days before their migration. See the [GitHub blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-09-24-enhanced-billing-platform-for-enterprises/).

If your account does not have a valid payment method on file, usage is blocked once you use up your quota.

By default, if you have a valid payment method on file, spending is limited to $0 USD until you set a budget. You can set and manage a budget to limit spending for a product or SKU. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-billing/using-budgets-control-spending).

Outside of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, the new billing platform is available to:

* Organization accounts on a {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} plan created after February 4, 2025.
* Personal accounts (either on {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}) created after February 13, 2025.<br><br>

For existing personal accounts created before February 13, 2025, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will migrate personal accounts to the new billing platform by June 30, 2025.

Once extracted, you can run {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} processes by running the `codeql` executable in a couple of ways:

* By executing `<extraction-root>/codeql/codeql`, where `<extraction-root>` is the folder where you extracted the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %}
package.
* By adding `<extraction-root>/codeql` to your `PATH`, so that you
can run the executable as just `codeql`.

At this point, you can execute {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} commands. For a full list of the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %} commands, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual)."

We recommend securing your enterprise with the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_security_configuration %}, then evaluating the security findings on your repositories before configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-code-security/securing-your-enterprise/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-to-your-enterprise).

With {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations %}, you can create collections of enablement settings for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s security products to meet the specific security needs of your enterprise. For example, you can create a different {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} for each organization or group of similar organizations to reflect their different levels of security requirements and compliance obligations. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-code-security/securing-your-enterprise/creating-a-custom-security-configuration-for-your-enterprise).

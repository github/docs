{% note %}

**Note:** The default {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configuration %} for an organization is only automatically applied to new repositories created in your organization. If a repository is transferred into your organization, you will still need to apply an appropriate {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configuration %} to the repository manually.

1. Choose a recovery verification factor.

    * If you've used your current device to log into this account before and would like to use the device for verification, click **Verify with this device**.
    * If you've previously set up an SSH key on this account and would like to use the SSH key for verification, click **SSH key**.
    * If you've previously set up a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} and would like to use the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} for verification, click **{% data variables.product.pat_generic_caps %}**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For security reasons, an authentication factor may not be available for recovery, even if you've used that authentication method with the account before. For example, SSH keys are removed from accounts after a period of inactivity.

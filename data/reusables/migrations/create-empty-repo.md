1. Create a new repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)."

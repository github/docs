## Linking to an existing codespace

You can create links to your existing codespaces. This is useful if you have a long-lived codespace that you return to frequently. You can save the link in a location of your choice, as an alternative to using the link on https://github.com/codespaces.

{% note %}

**Note**: You can only open your own codespaces. If someone clicks a link to one of your codespaces they will see a 404 error message.

{% endnote %}

Create a link using one of the following URL patterns. In these URLs `CODESPACE-NAME` represents the unique, permanent name of the codespace, such as `literate-space-parakeet-w5vg5ww5p793g7g9`, not the codespace's display name. You can find the name of a codespace by copying the link to the codespace on your https://github.com/codespaces page and extracting the codespace name from the URL.

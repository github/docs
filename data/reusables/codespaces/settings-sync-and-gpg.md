Your list of trusted repositories for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} is shared between the GPG verification and Settings Sync features. Assuming you have both features enabled, if you have added a selected list of trusted repositories for GPG verification, Settings Sync is turned on in codespaces created from these repositories. If you trust a new repository for Settings Sync, GPG verification is enabled for the same repository. Although the features share the same list of trusted repositories, you can enable or disable GPG verification and Settings Sync independently.

{% note %}

**Note:** If you have previously enabled GPG verification for all repositories, we recommend changing your preferences to use a selected list of trusted repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/codespaces-reference/security-in-github-codespaces#using-settings-sync)."

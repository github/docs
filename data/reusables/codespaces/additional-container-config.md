#### Additional dev container configuration files

If you are familiar with Docker, you may want to use a Dockerfile, or Docker Compose, to configure your codespace environment, in addition to the `devcontainer.json` file. You can do this by adding your `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files alongside the `devcontainer.json` file. For more information, see "[Using Images, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose](https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile)" on the Development Containers website.

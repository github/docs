{% note %}

**Note:** You must set a spending limit before you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}.

{% endnote %}

By default, your organization or enterprise will have a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} spending limit of $0, which prevents new codespaces from being created or existing codespaces from being opened. To allow your users to create codespaces in your organization, set the limit to a value higher than $0.

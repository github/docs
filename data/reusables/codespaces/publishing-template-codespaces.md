   **Note:** If you start from {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s blank template, you will not see a list of changes unless you have already initialized your directory as a Git repository. To publish codespaces created from the blank template, click **Publish to {% data variables.product.company_short %}** in the "Source Control" view, then skip to step 5.

   {% endnote %}
1. To commit your staged changes, type a commit message describing the change you've made, then click **Commit**.

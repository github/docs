## Codespace logs

These logs contain detailed information about the codespace, the container, the session, and the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} environment. They are useful for diagnosing connection issues and other unexpected behavior. For example, the codespace freezes but the "Reload Windows" option unfreezes it for a few minutes, or you are randomly disconnected from the codespace but able to reconnect immediately.

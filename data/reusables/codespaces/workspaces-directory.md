When you create a codespace, your repository is cloned into the `/workspaces` directory in your codespace. This is a persistent directory that is mounted into the container. Any changes you make inside this directory, including editing, adding, or deleting files, are preserved when you stop and start the codespace, and when you rebuild the container in the codespace.

Outside the `/workspaces` directory, your codespace contains a Linux directory structure that varies depending on the dev container image used to build your codespace. You can add files or make changes to files outside the `/workspaces` directory. For example, you can install new programs, or you can set up your shell configuration in a file such as `~/.bashrc`. As a non-root user, you may not automatically have write access to certain directories, but most images allow root access to these directories with the `sudo` command.

Outside `/workspaces`, with the exception of the `/tmp` directory, the directories in a codespace are tied to the lifecycle of the container. This means any changes you make are preserved when you stop and start your codespace, but are not preserved when you rebuild the container.

Typically, you can run your codespace on a choice of remote machine, from 2 cores to 32 cores. Each of these has a different level of resources and a different billing tier. For information, see "[About billing for Codespaces](/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces)."

By default the machine type with the lowest valid resources is used when you create a codespace.

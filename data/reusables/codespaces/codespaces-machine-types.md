Typically, you can run your codespace on a choice of remote machine types. These machine types offer a choice of hardware specifications ranging from 2 cores to 32 cores, although the full range of machine types may not always be available. Each machine type has a different level of resources and a different billing tier. For information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)."

By default the machine type with the lowest valid resources is used when you create a codespace.

You can customize your codespace by adjusting the amount of vCPUs and RAM, adding dotfiles to personalize your environment, or by modifying the tools and scripts installed. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace)."

{% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} uses a file called `devcontainer.json` to configure the development container that you use when you work in a codespace. Each repository can contain one or more  `devcontainer.json` files, to give you exactly the development environment you need to work on your code in a codespace.

On launch, {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} uses a `devcontainer.json` file, and any dependent files that make up the dev container configuration, to install tools and runtimes, and perform other setup tasks that the project requires. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers)."

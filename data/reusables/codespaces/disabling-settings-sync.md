You can turn off Settings Sync to stop syncing settings to and from an instance of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}.

When you turn off Settings Sync in a codespace, new codespaces continue to use the settings cached from the last time your settings were pushed to the cloud. If you use the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} web client for codespaces, and want codespaces to use the default settings instead of your cached settings, you can disable Settings Sync. For more information, see "[Managing your preferences for Settings Sync](/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#managing-your-preferences-for-settings-sync)."

If you want to return to using the default {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} settings in all instances of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}, including the desktop application, you can clear the cache in the cloud when you turn off Settings Sync.

1. If Settings Sync is currently turned off in your instance of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}, and you want to clear your cached settings, you must first turn it on. For instructions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#turning-on-settings-sync-in-a-codespace)."

**Note:** When you rebuild the container in a codespace, changes you have made outside the `/workspaces` directory are cleared. Changes you have made inside the `/workspaces` directory, which includes the clone of the repository or template from which you created the codespace, are preserved over a rebuild. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/getting-started/deep-dive#about-the-directory-structure-of-a-codespace)."

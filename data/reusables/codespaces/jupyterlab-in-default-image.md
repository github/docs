The default container image includes JupyterLab, so codespaces created from the default image will always have JupyterLab installed. For more information about the default image, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration)" and [the `devcontainers/images` repository](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/universal). If you're not using the default image in your dev container configuration, you can install JupyterLab by adding the `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python` feature to your `devcontainer.json` file. You should include the option `"installJupyterlab": true`. For more information, see [the README for the `python` feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/python#python-python), in the `devcontainers/features` repository.

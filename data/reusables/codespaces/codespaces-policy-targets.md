1. By default the policy is set to apply to all repositories, if you want it to apply only to some of the repositories in your organization, click **All repositories** and then click **Selected repositories** in the dropdown menu.

   {% note %}

   **Note**: If you're adding a constraint to an existing policy that already contains the "Maximum codespaces per user" constraint, you won't be able to apply the policy to selected repositories. This is because the "Maximum codespaces per user" constraint always applies to all repositories in the organization.

   {% endnote %}

   With **Selected repositories** selected:
   1. Click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="The settings icon" %}.

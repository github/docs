* The organization has set a non-zero spending limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}.
* The codespace is created from one of the organization's repositories, or from a fork of one of the organization's repositories. This includes {% ifversion ghec %}public, private, and internal{% elsif fpt %}both public and private{% endif %} repositories.
* The user creating the codespace is a member or collaborator of the organization, and the organization has enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} for this user. This can include all members and collaborators if the organization has chosen to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} for all users. If {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} isn't enabled for a user, they can still create codespaces from public repositories in the organization, but the user will pay for these codespaces.

You can use Settings Sync to share these settings across all codespaces you open in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} web client and desktop application. If you're working in the web client, Settings Sync is disabled by default, and you must enable Settings Sync to push changes to your settings or pull in new changes you have made elsewhere. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#settings-sync)."

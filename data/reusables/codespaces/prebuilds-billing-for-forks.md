If you create prebuilds for a forked repository, the storage cost of those prebuilds is subtracted from your monthly included storage, while available. If you have used all of your included storage, and you have set up billing, your personal account will be billed. This is true even when the codespaces you create for a fork are paid for by the organization that owns the parent repository.

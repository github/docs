Once you have created a secret, it will be available when you create a new codespace or restart the codespace. If you've created a secret on {% data variables.product.github %} and you want to use it in a currently running codespace, stop the codespace and then restart it. For information about stopping the codespace, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/codespaces-reference/using-the-vs-code-command-palette-in-codespaces#suspending-or-stopping-a-codespace)."

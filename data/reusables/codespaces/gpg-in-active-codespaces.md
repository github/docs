Once you enable GPG verification, it will automatically take effect in any new codespaces you create from the relevant repositories. To have GPG verification take effect in an existing active codespace, you will need to stop and restart the codespace. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace)."

To set up your repository to use a custom dev container, you will need to create one or more `devcontainer.json` files. You can either add these from a predefined configuration template, in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, or you can write your own. For more information on dev container configurations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers)."

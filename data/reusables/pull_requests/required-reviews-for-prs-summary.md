Repository administrators{% ifversion edit-repository-rules %} or custom roles with the "edit repository rules" permission{% endif %} can require that all pull requests receive a specific number of approving reviews before someone merges the pull request into a protected branch. You can require approving reviews from people with write permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner.

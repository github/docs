You can translate English comments on a ticket into Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), Chinese (Simplified), French, or German. However, when responding to tickets, you should use English, unless your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan permits you to respond in Japanese. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/support/contacting-github-support/viewing-and-updating-support-tickets).

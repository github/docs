You can use the guest collaborator role to grant limited access to vendors and contractors. Guest collaborators:

* Are provisioned by your IdP, like all {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %}.
* Can be added as organization members or as collaborators in repositories.
* Cannot access internal repositories in the enterprise, except in organizations where they're added as a member.

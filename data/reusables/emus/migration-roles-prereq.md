* You'll need to access both your enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %} and your tenant on Entra ID.

  * To configure the {% data variables.product.prodname_emu_idp_oidc_application %} application on Entra ID, you must sign into the Entra ID tenant as a user with the Global Administrator role.
  * To sign in as the setup user for your enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, you must use a recovery code for the enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-recovery-codes-for-your-enterprise/downloading-your-enterprise-accounts-single-sign-on-recovery-codes)."

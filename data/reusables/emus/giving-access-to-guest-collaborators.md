When you have added a guest collaborator to your enterprise, to give the user access to repositories in the enterprise, you can do either of the following things.
- To give the user access to repositories in an organization, add the user as a member of the organization. The base permission policy for the organization determines whether the guest collaborator has access to internal and private repositories. If the base permission is set to "No permission", the guest collaborator will not have access to internal and private repositories unless added directly to one of the repositories as a collaborator, or through an authorized team. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization)."
- To give the user access to specific repositories, add the guest collaborator to the repositories as a repository collaborator. This gives the user access to the repository without giving them access to other internal or private repositories in the same organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#outside-collaborators-or-repository-collaborators)."

You can add sub-issues to an issue to quickly break down larger pieces of work into tasks. Sub-issues add support for hierarchies of issues on {% data variables.product.github %} by creating relationships between your issues. You can create multiple levels of sub-issues that accurately represent your project by breaking down tasks into exactly the amount of detail that you and your team require.

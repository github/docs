You can create an IP allow list by adding entries that each contain an IP address or address range. After you finish adding entries, you can check whether a particular IP address would be allowed by any of the enabled entries in your list.

Before the list restricts access to private assets owned by organizations in your enterprise, you must also enable allowed IP addresses.

When you enable the allow list, the IP addresses you have configured are immediately added to the allow lists of organizations in your enterprise. If you disable the allow list, the addresses are removed from the organization allow lists.

{% data reusables.identity-and-permissions.org-enterprise-allow-list-interaction %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization)."

You can choose to automatically add to your allow list any IP addresses configured for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} installed in your enterprise. The creator of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} can configure an allow list for their application, specifying the IP addresses at which the application runs. By inheriting their allow list into yours, you avoid connection requests from the application being refused. For more information, see "[Allowing access by GitHub Apps](#allowing-access-by-github-apps)."

1. We recommend you confirm that your users have SAML enabled and have a linked SCIM identity to avoid potential provisioning errors. For help auditing your users, see "[Auditing users for missing SCIM metadata](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/troubleshooting-identity-and-access-management#auditing-users-for-missing-scim-metadata)." For help resolving unlinked SCIM identities, see "[Troubleshooting identity and access management](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/troubleshooting-identity-and-access-management)."

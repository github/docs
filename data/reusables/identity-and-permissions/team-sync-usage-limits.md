### Usage limits

There are usage limits for the team synchronization feature. Exceeding these limits will lead to a degradation in performance and may cause synchronization failures.

* Maximum number of members in a GitHub team: 5,000
* Maximum number of members in a GitHub organization: 10,000
* Maximum number of teams in a GitHub organization: 1,500

These limits only apply to the use of the team synchronization feature. Your organization may have more members or teams than the limits above, but your use of the team synchronization feature will be impaired. These limits do not apply to SCIM-based linking of teams to SCIM groups.

1. Optionally, to enable push protection for your custom pattern, click **Enable**.

   {% note %}

   **Note:**
   - Push protection for custom patterns will only apply to repositories that have {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as push protection enabled. For more information about enabling push protection, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)."
   - Enabling push protection for commonly found custom patterns can be disruptive to contributors.

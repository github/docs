{% data variables.product.github %} bills for {% data variables.product.prodname_AS %} products on a per-committer basis. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security#managing-committers-and-costs).

You can enforce a policy that controls whether repository administrators are allowed to enable features for {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} in an organization's repositories. You can configure a policy for all organizations owned by your enterprise account, or for individual organizations that you choose.

Disallowing {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_cs_or_sp %} for an organization prevents repository administrators from enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_cs_or_sp %} features for additional repositories, but does not disable the features for repositories where the features are already enabled.

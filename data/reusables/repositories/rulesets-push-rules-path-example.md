You can use `fnmatch` syntax for this. For example, a restriction targeting `test/demo/**/*` prevents any pushes to files or folders in the `test/demo/` directory. A restriction targeting `test/docs/pushrules.md` prevents pushes specifically to the `pushrules.md` file in the `test/docs/` directory.

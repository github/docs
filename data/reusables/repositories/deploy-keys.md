You can launch projects from a repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %} to your server by using a deploy key, which is an SSH key that grants access to a single repository. {% data variables.product.product_name %} attaches the public part of the key directly to your repository instead of a personal account, and the private part of the key remains on your server. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/delivering-deployments)."

If a repository has any protected branches, you can't edit or upload files in the protected branch using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} to move your changes to a new branch and commit them. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop)."

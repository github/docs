Ruleset history lists events triggered by changes that affect your rulesets within the last 180 days.

You can view all the changes to a ruleset and revert back to a specific iteration. You can also download a JSON file containing the ruleset's configuration at a specific iteration. The bypass list of a ruleset is excluded from the exported JSON file.

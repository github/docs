Use [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07) to schedule workflows to run at specific UTC times. Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.

{% data reusables.repositories.cron %}

You can use these operators in any of the five fields:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| * | Any value | `15 * * * *` runs at every minute 15 of every hour of every day. |
| , | Value list separator | `2,10 4,5 * * *` runs at minute 2 and 10 of the 4th and 5th hour of every day. |
| - | Range of values | `30 4-6 * * *` runs at minute 30 of the 4th, 5th, and 6th hour. |
| / | Step values | `20/15 * * * *` runs every 15 minutes starting from minute 20 through 59 (minutes 20, 35, and 50). |

A single workflow can be triggered by multiple `schedule` events. Access the `schedule` event that triggered the workflow through the `github.event.schedule` context. This example triggers the workflow to run at 5:30 UTC every Monday-Thursday, and 17:30 UTC on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but skips the `Not on Monday or Wednesday` step on Monday and Wednesday.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 5 * * 1,3'
    - cron: '30 5,17 * * 2,4'

jobs:
  test_schedule:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Not on Monday or Wednesday
        if: github.event.schedule != '30 5 * * 1,3'
        run: echo "This step will be skipped on Monday and Wednesday"
      - name: Every time
        run: echo "This step will always run"
```

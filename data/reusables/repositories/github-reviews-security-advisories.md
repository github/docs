{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will review each published security advisory, add it to the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, and may use the security advisory to send {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to affected repositories. If the security advisory comes from a fork, we'll only send an alert if the fork owns a package, published under a unique name, on a public package registry. This process can take up to 72 hours and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} may contact you for more information.

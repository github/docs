Deploy keys with write access can perform the same actions as an organization member with admin access, or a collaborator on a personal repository. For more information, see "[Repository roles for an organization](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization)" and "[Permission levels for a personal account repository](/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)."

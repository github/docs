As an alternative to branch protection rules{% ifversion ghes < 3.16 %} or tag protection rules{% endif %}, you can create rulesets. Rulesets have a few advantages over branch{% ifversion ghes < 3.16 %} and tag{% endif %} protection rules, such as statuses, and better discoverability without requiring admin access. You can also apply multiple rulesets at the same time. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)."

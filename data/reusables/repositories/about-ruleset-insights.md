On the "Rule Insights" page, you will see a timeline of the following user actions. You can use filters to find what you're looking for.

* Actions that have been checked against one or more rulesets and passed.
* Actions that have been checked against one or more rulesets and failed.
* Actions where someone has bypassed one or more rulesets.

If a ruleset is running in "Evaluate" mode, you can see actions that would have passed or failed if the ruleset had been active.

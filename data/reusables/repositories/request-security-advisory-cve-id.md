If you want a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, and don't already have one, you can request a CVE identification number from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} usually reviews the request within 72 hours. Requesting a CVE identification number doesn't make your security advisory public. If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you make your security advisory public. Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can request a CVE identification number.

If you already have a CVE you want to use, for example, if you use a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) other than {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, add the CVE to the security advisory form. This may happen, for example, if you want to get the advisory consistent with other communications you plan to send out at publication time. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} cannot assign CVEs to your project if it is covered by another CNA.

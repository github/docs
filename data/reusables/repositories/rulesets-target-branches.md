To target branches or tags, in the "Target branches" or "Target tags" section, select **Add a target**, then select how you want to include or exclude branches or tags. You can use `fnmatch` syntax to include or exclude branches or tags based on a pattern. For more information, see "[Using `fnmatch` syntax](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#using-fnmatch-syntax)."

You can add multiple targeting criteria to the same ruleset. For example, you could include the default branch, include any branches matching the pattern `*feature*`, and then specifically exclude a branch matching the pattern `not-a-feature`.

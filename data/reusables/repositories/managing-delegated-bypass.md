## Managing requests to bypass push rules

>[!NOTE] Delegated bypass for push rules is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

You can view and manage all requests for bypass privileges on the â€œBypass Requests" page, located under the **Rules** settings of the repository.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. Click **Bypass Requests**.

You can filter requests by approver (member of the bypass list), requester (contributor making the request), timeframe, and status. The following statuses are assigned to a request:

|Status|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`Cancelled`| The request has been cancelled by the contributor.|
|`Completed`|The request has been approved and the commit(s) have been pushed to the repository.|
|`Denied`|The request has been reviewed and denied.|
|`Expired`| The request has expired. Requests are valid for 7 days. |
|`Open`| The request has either not yet been reviewed, or has been approved but the commit(s) have not been pushed to the repository.  |

When a contributor requests bypass privileges to push a commit containing restricted content, members of the bypass list all receive an email notification containing a link to the request. Members of the bypass list then have 7 days to review and either approve or deny the request before the request expires.

The contributor is notified of the decision by email and must take the required action. If the request is approved, the contributor can push the commit containing the restricted content to the repository. If the request is denied, the contributor must remove the restricted content from the commit in order to successfully push the commit to the repository.

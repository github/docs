When viewing a Markdown file, you can click {% ifversion code-view-ui %}**Code**{% else %}{% octicon "code" aria-label="The code icon" %}{% endif %} at the top of the file to disable Markdown rendering and view the file's source instead.

{% ifversion code-view-ui %}

{% else %}

{% endif %}

Disabling Markdown rendering enables you to use source view features, such as line linking, which is not possible when viewing rendered Markdown files.

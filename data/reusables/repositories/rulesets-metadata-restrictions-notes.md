**Notes:**
* Adding metadata restrictions can impact the experience of people contributing to your repository. Before you enact a ruleset with metadata restrictions, you can select the "Evaluate" enforcement status for your ruleset to test the effects of any metadata restrictions without impacting contributors. For more information on metadata restrictions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#important-considerations-for-metadata-restrictions)."
* Metadata restrictions are intended to increase consistency between commits in your repository. They are not intended to replace security measures such as requiring code review via pull requests.
* If you squash merge a branch, all commits on that branch must meet any metadata requirements for the base branch.

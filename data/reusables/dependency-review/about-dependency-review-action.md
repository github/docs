The "{% data variables.dependency-review.action_name %}" refers to the specific action that can report on differences in a pull request within the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} context. See [`dependency-review-action`](https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action). You can use the {% data variables.dependency-review.action_name %} in your repository to enforce dependency reviews on your pull requests. The action scans for vulnerable versions of dependencies introduced by package version changes in pull requests, and warns you about the associated security vulnerabilities. This gives you better visibility of what's changing in a pull request, and helps prevent vulnerabilities being added to your repository.

1. The first time that you use Git to clone a repository or access data in a repository that you've already cloned, Git will request credentials. Provide the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} for the account with access to the repository.

   Git will cache the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} based on the full remote URL of the repository, and you'll be able to access and write repository data on {% data variables.location.product_location %} using the correct account.

You must periodically authenticate with your IdP to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. The duration of this login period is 24 hours unless specified otherwise by your IdP. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SSO sessions in your security settings. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-single-sign-on/viewing-and-managing-your-active-sso-sessions).

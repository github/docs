You must periodically authenticate with your SAML IdP to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SAML sessions in your security settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/viewing-and-managing-your-active-saml-sessions)."

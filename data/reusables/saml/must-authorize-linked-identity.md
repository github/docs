**Note:** If you have a linked identity for an organization, you can only use authorized personal access tokens and SSH keys with that organization, even if SAML is not enforced. You have a linked identity for an organization if you've ever authenticated via SAML SSO for that organization, unless an organization or enterprise owner later revoked the linked identity. For more information about revoking linked identities, see "[Viewing and managing a member's SAML access to your organization](/organizations/granting-access-to-your-organization-with-saml-single-sign-on/viewing-and-managing-a-members-saml-access-to-your-organization)" and "[Viewing and managing a user's SAML access to your enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/viewing-and-managing-a-users-saml-access-to-your-enterprise)."

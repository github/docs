When you use {% ifversion ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}{% else %}an IdP for IAM on {% data variables.product.product_name %}{% endif %}, SAML SSO controls and secures access to enterprise resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. SCIM automatically creates user accounts and manages access to your enterprise when you make changes on your IdP. You can also synchronize teams on {% data variables.product.github %} with groups on your IdP.

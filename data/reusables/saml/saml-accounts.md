If you configure SAML SSO, members of your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization will continue to log into their user accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. When a member accesses resources within your organization that uses SAML SSO, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} redirects the member to your IdP to authenticate. After successful authentication, your IdP redirects the member back to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, where the member can access your organization's resources.

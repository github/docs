By default, Git automatically removes consecutive newlines. To leave the commit message exactly as you entered it, use the `--cleanup=verbatim` option on your commit. For more information, see [`--cleanup=<mode>`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---cleanupltmodegt) in the Git documentation.

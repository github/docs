When a new secret is detected, {% data variables.product.product_name %} notifies all users with access to security alerts for the repository according to their notification preferences. These users include:
* Repository administrators
* Security managers
* Users with custom roles with read/write access
* Organization owners and enterprise owners, if they are administrators of repositories where secrets were leaked

> [!NOTE]
> Commit authors who've accidentally committed secrets will be notified, regardless of their notification preferences.

You will receive an email notification if:
* You are watching the repository.
* You have enabled notifications for "All Activity", or for custom "Security alerts" on the repository{% ifversion secret-scanning-notification-settings %}.
* In your notification settings, under "Subscriptions", then under "Watching", you have selected to receive notifications by email.{% endif %}

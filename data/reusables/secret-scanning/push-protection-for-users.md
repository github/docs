Additionally, push protection _for users_ automatically protects you from accidentally committing secrets to public repositories, regardless of whether the repository has {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} enabled. Push protection for users is on by default, but you can disable the feature at any time through your personal account settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection/push-protection-for-users)."

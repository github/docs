Validity checks help you prioritize alerts by telling you which secrets are `active` or `inactive`. An `active` secret is one that could still be exploited, so these alerts should be reviewed and remediated as a priority.

By default, {% data variables.product.company_short %} checks the validity of {% data variables.product.company_short %} tokens and displays the validitation status of the token in the alert view.

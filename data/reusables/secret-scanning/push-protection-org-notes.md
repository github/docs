**Notes:**
- The option to enable push protection is visible for published patterns only.
- Push protection for custom patterns will only apply to repositories in your organization that have {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} as push protection enabled. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning#enabling-secret-scanning-as-a-push-protection-for-an-organization)."
- Enabling push protection for commonly found custom patterns can be disruptive to contributors.

Members {% ifversion push-protection-bypass-fine-grained-permissions %}with permission to review and manage bypass requests {% else %}of the bypass list{% endif %} are still protected from accidentally pushing secrets to a repository. If they attempt to push a commit containing a secret, their push is still blocked, but they can choose to bypass the block by specifying a reason for allowing the push. Members {% ifversion push-protection-bypass-fine-grained-permissions %}with permission to review and manage bypass requests {% else %}of the bypass list {% endif %}do not have to request bypass privileges from other members in order to override the block.

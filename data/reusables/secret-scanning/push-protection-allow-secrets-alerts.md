When you allow a secret to be pushed, an alert is created in the **Security** tab. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} closes the alert and doesn't send a notification if you specify that the secret is a false positive or used only in tests. If you specify that the secret is real and that you will fix it later, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} keeps the security alert open and sends notifications to the author of the commit, as well as to repository administrators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)."

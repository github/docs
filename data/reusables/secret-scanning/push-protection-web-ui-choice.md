When you use the web UI to attempt to commit a supported secret to a repository secured by push protection, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will block the commit.

You will see a dialog box with information about the secret's location, as well as options allowing you to push the secret. The secret will also be underlined in the file so you can easily find it.

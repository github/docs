Older versions of certain tokens may not be supported by push protection as these tokens may generate a higher number of false positives than their most recent version. Push protection may also not apply to legacy tokens. For tokens such as Azure Storage Keys, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} only supports _recently created_ tokens, not tokens that match the legacy patterns.

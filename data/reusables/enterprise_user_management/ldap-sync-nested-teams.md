As part of its optimization configuration, LDAP Sync will not transfer your nested team structure. To create child and parent team relationships, you must manually recreate the nested team structure and sync it with the corresponding LDAP group. For more information, see "[Creating teams](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/user-management/creating-teams/#creating-teams-with-ldap-sync-enabled)"

When using SAML or CAS, two-factor authentication is not supported or managed on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance, but may be supported by the external authentication provider. Two-factor authentication enforcement on organizations is not available. For more information about enforcing two-factor authentication on organizations, see "[Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](/enterprise/user/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization/)."

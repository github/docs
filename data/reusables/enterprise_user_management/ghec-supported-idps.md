If you choose to create an enterprise that uses personal accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, you can configure additional authentication with an external identity management system that adheres to the SAML 2.0 standard. {% data variables.product.company_short %} also officially supports and tests some identity management systems. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise#supported-identity-providers)."

{% data reusables.enterprise_user_management.emu-paved-path-iam-integrations %} If you use a partner identity provider (IdP), you can configure one application on your IdP to provide authentication and provisioning. The IdP must support the SAML 2.0 standard. Alternatively, if you use Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD), you can configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. If you don't use a partner IdP, or if you only use a partner IdP for authentication, you can integrate IdPs that implement the SAML 2.0 and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 standards. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users#about-authentication-and-user-provisioning)."

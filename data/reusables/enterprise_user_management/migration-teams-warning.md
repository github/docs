When you migrate to a new IdP or tenant, connections between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} teams and IdP groups are removed, and are not reinstated after the migration. This will remove all members from the team and leave the team unconnected to your IdP, which may cause disruption if you use team sync to manage access to organizations or licenses from your IdP. We recommend you use the "External groups" endpoints of the REST API to gather information about your teams setup before you migrate, and to reinstate connections afterwards. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/teams/external-groups)."

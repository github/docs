To use SCIM with your organization, you must use a third-party-owned {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}. The {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} must be authorized by, and subsequently acts on behalf of, a specific {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user. If the user who last authorized this {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} leaves or is removed from the organization, SCIM will stop working. To avoid this issue, we recommend creating a dedicated user account to configure SCIM. This user account must be an organization owner and will consume a license.

{% note %}

**Note:** To avoid exceeding the rate limit on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, do not assign more than 1,000 users per hour to the IdP application. If you use groups to assign users to the IdP application, do not add more than 100 users to each group per hour. If you exceed these thresholds, attempts to provision users may fail with a "rate limit" error.

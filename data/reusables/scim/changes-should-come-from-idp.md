If SCIM provisioning is implemented for your organization, any changes to a user's organization membership should be triggered from the identity provider. If a user is invited to an organization manually instead of by an existing SCIM integration, their user account may not get properly linked to their SCIM identity. This can prevent the user account from being deprovisioned via SCIM in the future. If a user is removed manually instead of by an existing SCIM integration, a stale linked identity will remain, which can lead to issues if the user needs to re-join the organization.

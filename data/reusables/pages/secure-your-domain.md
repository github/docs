If your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site is disabled but has a custom domain set up, it is at risk of a domain takeover. Having a custom domain configured with your DNS provider while your site is disabled could result in someone else hosting a site on one of your subdomains.

Verifying your custom domain prevents other GitHub users from using your domain with their repositories. If your domain is not verified, and your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site is disabled, you should immediately update or remove your DNS records with your DNS provider.

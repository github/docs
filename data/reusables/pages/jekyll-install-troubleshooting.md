**Tip:** If you see a Ruby error when you try to install Jekyll using Bundler, you may need to use a package manager, such as [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), to manage your Ruby installation. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#jekyll--macos)" in the Jekyll documentation.

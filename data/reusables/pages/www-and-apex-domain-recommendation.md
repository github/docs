If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend also setting up a `www` subdomain. If you configure the correct records for each domain type through your DNS provider, {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} will automatically create redirects between the domains. For example, if you configure `www.example.com` as the custom domain for your site, and you have {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} DNS records set up for the apex and `www` domains, then `example.com` will redirect to `www.example.com`. If you instead configure `example.com` as the custom domain, then `www.example.com` will redirect to `example.com`. Automatic redirects also apply to other subdomains, as `www.blog.example.com` will redirect to `blog.example.com` or vice versa. It is not possible to configure a domain that starts with `www.www.`.

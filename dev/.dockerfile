#1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future), we should add support for the  -y  flag

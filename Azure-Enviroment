# **What it does**: Build and deploy an Azure preview environment for this PR
# **Why we have it**: It's our preview environment deploy mechanism, to docs-internal and docs public repo
# **Who does it impact**: All contributors.

  # The advantage of 'pull_request' over 'pull_request_target' is that we
  # can make changes to this file and test them in a pull request, instead
  # of relying on landing it in 'main' first.
  # From a security point of view, its arguably safer this way because
  # unlike 'pull_request_target', these only have secrets if the pull
  # request creator has permission to access secrets.

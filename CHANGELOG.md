When interacting with the GitHub MCP server for a public repository, push protection blocks secrets from appearing in AI-generated responses and also prevents secrets from being included in any actions you perform, such as creating an issue.

See [Working with push protection and the GitHub MCP server](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection/working-with-push-protection-and-the-github-mcp-server).

To address common pain points that developers face when remediating a leaked secret, we created a new article, "[Remediating a leaked secret](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection/remediating-a-leaked-secret)". 

The new guide incorporates cross-platform GitHub tools, as well as opinionated guidance from GitHub's secret scanning team, to walk the developer through a thorough remediation process.

It also clearly communicates the risks of leaked secrets, the challenges of remediation, and the value of enabling [GitHub Secret Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security#github-secret-protection).

**28 July 2025**

We have restructured the general "[Billing and payments](https://docs.github.com/en/billing)" articles to align with the Copilot and Actions docs. In addition, we've combined a few old "About" articles to directly answer common questions that new users have: [How GitHub billing works](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/get-started/how-billing-works) and [Introduction to billing and licensing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/get-started/introduction-to-billing).

Many enterprise customers want to measure the downstream impact of Copilot on their company, looking beyond leading metrics like adoption and usage.

Inspired by [GitHub's latest guidance](https://resources.github.com/engineering-system-success-playbook/), we've published three guides that provide usecases, training resources, and metrics to help you plan and measure your rollout to achieve real-world goals, such as increasing test coverage.

Get started at [Achieving your company's engineering goals with GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/achieve-engineering-goals).

We've published a new guide about how to combine use of GitHub Copilot's agent mode with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to complete complex tasks through agentic "loops" - illustrated through an accessibility compliance example. The guide also discusses best practices and benefits around using these two features together. See [Enhancing Copilot agent mode with MCP](https://docs.github.com/copilot/tutorials/enhancing-copilot-agent-mode-with-mcp).

We’ve published a new set of new documentation articles designed to help users make the most of the **Dependabot metrics page** in the organization’s security overview.

These clear, actionable guides help users:

- **[View metrics for Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-overview/viewing-metrics-for-dependabot-alerts)**
  This article is aimed at security and engineering leads who want to learn how to access and interpret key metrics, so they can quickly assess their organization’s exposure and remediation progress.

- **[Understand your organization’s exposure to vulnerable dependencies](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/securing-your-organization/understanding-your-organizations-exposure-to-vulnerabilites/about-your-exposure-to-vulnerable-dependencies)**
  In this article, security analysts and compliance teams get a deep dive into how vulnerable dependencies are tracked and what these numbers mean for their risk landscape.

- **[Prioritize Dependabot alerts using metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/securing-your-organization/understanding-your-organizations-exposure-to-vulnerabilites/prioritizing-dependabot-alerts-using-metrics)**
  This guide provides engineering managers and remediation teams with strategies for using metrics to focus the team’s efforts where they matter most, making remediation more efficient.

To help learners feel confident they are building real coding skills while using Copilot, we published [Setting up Copilot for learning to code](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/setting-up-copilot-for-learning-to-code).

This article helps learners take their first steps in coding with Copilot acting as a tutor, rather than a code completion tool. Configuring Copilot for learning emphasizes skill development and gives learners a way to use Copilot as a daily tool to foster learning and coding independence.

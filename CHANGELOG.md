We've published a new scenario-based guide for Copilot: [Learning a new programming language with GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/learning-a-new-programming-language-with-github-copilot).

This guide is for developers who are proficient with at least one programming language and want to learn an additional language. It provides information about how you can use Copilot as your personalized learning assistant. It also provides many ready-made prompts that you can use when you are learning a new programming language.

GitHub Models launched [Pay-As-You-Go billing and Bring Your Own Key support](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-24-github-models-now-supports-moving-beyond-free-limits/). This provides real production usage for the first time and lays the foundation for Models to scale beyond a free sandbox.

See [About Billing for GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-models) and [Using your own API keys in GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/github-models/github-models-at-scale/set-up-custom-model-integration-models-byok).

We’ve restructured our documentation around Copilot’s AI models to make it easier for users to understand, choose, and configure models across clients and plans. See [Supported AI models in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/supported-ai-models-in-copilot) and [Choosing the right AI model for your task](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).

We've published a new responsible AI article for Copilot: [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot code completion](https://docs.github.com/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-code-completion). This provides RAI transparency information for this feature of GitHub Copilot.

We've published a new article for people learning to code: [Developing your project locally](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/developing-your-project-locally).

This tutorial helps learners gain core skills needed to set up any project locally by working through an example client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to help new coders use GitHub tools to recognize patterns across different technologies and build confidence in their ability to set up any project locally.

To manage System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) integration with confidence, customers need to understand the different types of deprovisioning, the actions that trigger them, and their options for reinstating deprovisioned users.

We've published a new article to answer questions around suspending and reinstating Enterprise Managed Users, or users where SCIM is enabled on GitHub Enterprise Server: [Deprovisioning and reinstating users with SCIM](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/deprovisioning-and-reinstating-users).

We've added a new scenario-based guide for the Builder persona: [Using Copilot to explore a codebase](https://docs.github.com/copilot/tutorials/using-copilot-to-explore-a-codebase).

**24 April 2025**

To help learners feel confident they are building real coding skills while using Copilot, we published [Setting up Copilot for learning to code](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/setting-up-copilot-for-learning-to-code).

This article helps learners take their first steps in coding with Copilot acting as a tutor, rather than a code completion tool. Configuring Copilot for learning emphasizes skill development and gives learners a way to use Copilot as a daily tool to foster learning and coding independence.

# Docs changelog

**30 June 2025**

Many enterprise customers want to measure the downstream impact of Copilot on their company, looking beyond leading metrics like adoption and usage.

Inspired by [GitHub's latest guidance](https://resources.github.com/engineering-system-success-playbook/), we've published three guides that provide usecases, training resources, and metrics to help you plan and measure your rollout to achieve real-world goals, such as increasing test coverage.

Get started at [Achieving your company's engineering goals with GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/achieve-engineering-goals).

We've published a new guide about how to combine use of GitHub Copilot's agent mode with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to complete complex tasks through agentic "loops" - illustrated through an accessibility compliance example. The guide also discusses best practices and benefits around using these two features together. See [Enhancing Copilot agent mode with MCP](https://docs.github.com/copilot/tutorials/enhancing-copilot-agent-mode-with-mcp).

We’ve published a new set of new documentation articles designed to help users make the most of the **Dependabot metrics page** in the organization’s security overview.

These clear, actionable guides help users:

- **[View metrics for Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-overview/viewing-metrics-for-dependabot-alerts)**
  This article is aimed at security and engineering leads who want to learn how to access and interpret key metrics, so they can quickly assess their organization’s exposure and remediation progress.

- **[Understand your organization’s exposure to vulnerable dependencies](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/securing-your-organization/understanding-your-organizations-exposure-to-vulnerabilites/about-your-exposure-to-vulnerable-dependencies)**
  In this article, security analysts and compliance teams get a deep dive into how vulnerable dependencies are tracked and what these numbers mean for their risk landscape.

- **[Prioritize Dependabot alerts using metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/securing-your-organization/understanding-your-organizations-exposure-to-vulnerabilites/prioritizing-dependabot-alerts-using-metrics)**
  This guide provides engineering managers and remediation teams with strategies for using metrics to focus the team’s efforts where they matter most, making remediation more efficient.

We've published a new scenario-based guide for Copilot: [Learning a new programming language with GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/learning-a-new-programming-language-with-github-copilot).

This guide is for developers who are proficient with at least one programming language and want to learn an additional language. It provides information about how you can use Copilot as your personalized learning assistant. It also provides many ready-made prompts that you can use when you are learning a new programming language.

GitHub Models launched [Pay-As-You-Go billing and Bring Your Own Key support](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-24-github-models-now-supports-moving-beyond-free-limits/). This provides real production usage for the first time and lays the foundation for Models to scale beyond a free sandbox.

See [About Billing for GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/about-billing-for-github-models) and [Using your own API keys in GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/github-models/github-models-at-scale/set-up-custom-model-integration-models-byok).

**23 June 2025**

We’ve restructured our documentation around Copilot’s AI models to make it easier for users to understand, choose, and configure models across clients and plans. See [Supported AI models in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/supported-ai-models-in-copilot) and [Choosing the right AI model for your task](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).

We've published a new responsible AI article for Copilot: [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot code completion](https://docs.github.com/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-code-completion). This provides RAI transparency information for this feature of GitHub Copilot.

We've published a new article for people learning to code: [Developing your project locally](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/developing-your-project-locally).

This tutorial helps learners gain core skills needed to set up any project locally by working through an example client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to help new coders use GitHub tools to recognize patterns across different technologies and build confidence in their ability to set up any project locally.

To manage System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) integration with confidence, customers need to understand the different types of deprovisioning, the actions that trigger them, and their options for reinstating deprovisioned users.

We've published a new article to answer questions around suspending and reinstating Enterprise Managed Users, or users where SCIM is enabled on GitHub Enterprise Server: [Deprovisioning and reinstating users with SCIM](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/deprovisioning-and-reinstating-users).

**24 April 2025**

To help learners feel confident they are building real coding skills while using Copilot, we published [Setting up Copilot for learning to code](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/setting-up-copilot-for-learning-to-code).

This article helps learners take their first steps in coding with Copilot acting as a tutor, rather than a code completion tool. Configuring Copilot for learning emphasizes skill development and gives learners a way to use Copilot as a daily tool to foster learning and coding independence.

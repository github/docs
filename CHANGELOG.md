# Docs changelog

**13 June 2025**

We've published a new article for people learning to code: "[Developing your project locally](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/developing-your-project-locally)."

This tutorial helps learners gain core skills needed to set up any project locally by working through an example client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to help new coders use GitHub tools to recognize patterns across different technologies and build confidence in their ability to set up any project locally.

To manage System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) integration with confidence, customers need to understand the different types of deprovisioning, the actions that trigger them, and their options for reinstating deprovisioned users.

We've published a new article to answer questions around suspending and reinstating Enterprise Managed Users, or users where SCIM is enabled on GitHub Enterprise Server: "[Deprovisioning and reinstating users with SCIM](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/deprovisioning-and-reinstating-users)".

**24 April 2025**

To help learners feel confident they are building real coding skills while using Copilot, we published [Setting up Copilot for learning to code](https://docs.github.com/get-started/learning-to-code/setting-up-copilot-for-learning-to-code).

This article helps learners take their first steps in coding with Copilot acting as a tutor, rather than a code completion tool. Configuring Copilot for learning emphasizes skill development and gives learners a way to use Copilot as a daily tool to foster learning and coding independence.

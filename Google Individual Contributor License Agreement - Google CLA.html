  <h1>Google Individual Contributor License Agreement</h1>
  
    <p>In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
    Contributions from any person or entity, Google LLC ("Google") must
    have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been
    signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms
    below.  This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well
    as the protection of Google; it does not change your rights to use
    your own Contributions for any other purpose.</p>

    <p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
    present and future Contributions submitted to Google.  Except for the
    license granted herein to Google and recipients of software
    distributed by Google, You reserve all right, title, and interest in
    and to Your Contributions.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Definitions.</p>

        <p>"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
        authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
        Google.  For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.
        For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power,
        direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
        entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
        percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
        ownership of such entity.</p>

        <p>"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
        including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is
        intentionally submitted by You to Google for inclusion in, or
        documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Google (the
        "Work").  For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any
        form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Google or
        its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
        electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
        tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Google for the
        purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
        communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
        writing by You as "Not a Contribution."</p>
      </li>

      <li><p>Grant of Copyright License.  Subject to the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Google and to
      recipients of software distributed by Google a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
      to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
      derivative works.</p></li>

      <li><p>Grant of Patent License.  Subject to the terms and conditions
      of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Google and to recipients of
      software distributed by Google a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
      section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
      import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
      only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
      infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
      Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
      submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You
      or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
      lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you
      have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
      then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
      that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
      is filed.</p></li>

      <li><p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
      license.  If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that
      you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you
      have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that
      employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your
      Contributions to Google, or that your employer has executed a separate
      Corporate CLA with Google.</p></li>

      <li><p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
      creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
      represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details
      of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not
      limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
      personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
      Contributions.</p></li>

      <li><p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
      except to the extent You desire to provide support.  You may provide
      support for free, for a fee, or not at all.  Unless required by
      applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
      on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
      warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
      or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p></li>

      <li><p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original
      creation, You may submit it to Google separately from any
      Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
      any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
      related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
      personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on
      behalf of a third-party: [named here]".</p></li>

      <li><p>You agree to notify Google of any facts or circumstances of
      which you become aware that would make these representations
      inaccurate in any respect.</p></li>

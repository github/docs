Configuring the template chooser
You can customize the issue template chooser that people see when creating a new issue in your repository by adding a config.yml file to the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder.

You can encourage contributors to use issue templates by setting blank_issues_enabled to false. If you set blank_issues_enabled to true, people will have the option to open a blank issue.

Note

If you used the legacy workflow to manually create an issue_template.md file in the .github folder and enable blank issues in your config.yml file, the template in issue_template.md will be used when people choose to open a blank issue. If you disable blank issues, the template will never be used.

If you prefer to receive certain reports outside of GitHub, you can direct people to external sites with contact_links.

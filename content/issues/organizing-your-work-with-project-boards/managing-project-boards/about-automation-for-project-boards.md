{% data reusables.project-management.automate-project-board-permissions %}  For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

You can automate actions based on triggering events for {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} columns. This eliminates some of the manual tasks in managing a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. For example, you can configure a "To do" column, where any new issues or pull requests you add to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} are automatically moved to the configured column. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/configuring-automation-for-project-boards)."  

{% data reusables.project-management.use-automated-template %}

{% data reusables.project-management.copy-project-boards %}

{% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board_caps %} automation can also help teams develop a shared understanding of a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}'s purpose and the team's development process by creating a standard workflow for certain actions.

{% data reusables.project-management.resync-automation %}

## Project progress tracking

You can track the progress on your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. Cards in the "To do", "In progress", or "Done" columns count toward the overall project progress. {% data reusables.project-management.project-progress-locations %}

{% data reusables.projects.project_boards_old %}

When you close a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}, any workflow automation that was configured for the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} will pause by default. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/closing-a-project-board)."

When you reopen a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}, you have the option to _sync_ automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the board.

1. Navigate to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} you want to reopen.
{% data reusables.project-management.click-menu %}

    * To reopen your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} without syncing automation, using the reopen drop-down menu, click **Reopen only**. Then, click **Reopen only**.

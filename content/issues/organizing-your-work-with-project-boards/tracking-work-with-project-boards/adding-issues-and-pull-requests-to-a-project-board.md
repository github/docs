You can add issue or pull request cards to your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} by:
* Dragging cards from the **Triage** section in the sidebar.
* Typing the issue or pull request URL in a card.
* Searching for issues or pull requests in the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} search sidebar.

You can put a maximum of 2,500 cards into each project column. If a column has reached the maximum number of cards, no cards can be moved into that column.

{% note %}

**Note:** You can also add notes to your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} to serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or to add related information to your {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-notes-to-a-project-board)."

For a "marked as duplicate" timeline event to appear, the user who creates the duplicate reference comment must have write access to the repository where they create the comment.

## Marking duplicates

To mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate, type "Duplicate of" followed by an issue or pull request number in the body of a new comment.

You can also use the {% data variables.product.company_short %}-provided saved replies, "Duplicate issue" or "Duplicate pull request." For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/about-saved-replies)."

## Unmarking duplicates

You can unmark duplicate issues and pull requests by clicking **Undo** in the timeline. This will add a new timeline event, indicating that the issue or pull request was unmarked.

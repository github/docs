## Navigating issue hierarchy

You can browse through all levels of sub-issues from the parent issue.

1. Navigate to the parent issue.
1. To view the sub-issues under another sub-issue, click the expand toggle ({% octicon "triangle-right" aria-hidden="true" %}).

## Finding a sub-issue's parent issue

When you view a sub-issue, you can always find a link back to the parent issue in the header below the issue title.

## Using sub-issues in your projects

You can add sub-issues to your projects and make use of the hierarchy data for building views, grouping items, and filtering your views. See [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields/about-parent-issue-and-sub-issue-progress-fields).

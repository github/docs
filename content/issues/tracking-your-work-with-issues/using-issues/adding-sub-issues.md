{% data reusables.issues.release-stage %}

You can add sub-issues to an issue to break down larger pieces of work into tasks. Your sub-issues show their relationship to the parent issue allowing you to track your work across {% data variables.product.github %}. Parent issues and sub-issue progress is also available in your {% data variables.projects.projects_v2 %}, allowing you to build views, filter, and group by parent issue.

Your sub-issues can themselves contain sub-issues, allowing you to create full hierarchies of issues that visualize entire projects or pieces of work and show the relationships between your issues.

You can add up to fifty sub-issues per parent issue and create up to eight levels of nested sub-issues.

## Creating a sub-issue

1. At the bottom of the issue description, click **Create sub-issue**.
1. In the dialog, type the title for your sub-issue.
1. Optionally, type the description for your issue, and set {% ifversion issue-types %}the issue type and{% endif %} any assignees, labels, projects, and milestones.
1. Optionally, if you want to continue create sub-issues for this parent issue, select **Create more sub-issues**.

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to use {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v2 %} to plan and track work. In this guide, you will create a new project, customize views, and add custom fields to manage a team backlog, iteration planning, and a team roadmap to communicate priorities and progress with your collaborators. You'll also set up built-in workflows to automatically manage the items in your project and charts to visualize items in your project.

## Prerequisites

You can either create an organization project or a user project. To create an organization project, you need a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization. For more information about creating an organization, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).

In this guide, you will add existing issues from repositories owned by your organization (for organization projects) or by you (for user projects) to your new project. For more information about creating issues, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

## Creating a project

First, create an organization project or a user project.

### Creating an organization project

{% data reusables.projects.create-project %}

### Creating a user project

{% data reusables.projects.create-user-project %}

## Setting your project description and README

{% data reusables.projects.project-description %}

## Adding items to your project

Next, add a few items to your project.

{% data reusables.projects.add-item-via-paste %}

Repeat the above steps a few times to add multiple items to your project.

For more information and other ways to add issues to your project, or about other items you can add to your project, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project).

## Adding draft issues to your project

Next, add a draft issue to your project.

{% data reusables.projects.add-draft-issue %}

## Adding fields

Next, create custom fields to manage the iteration, priority, and estimates for your project items.

### Creating an iteration field

Create an iteration field so you can plan and track your work over repeating blocks of time. Iterations can be configured to suit how you and your team works, with customizable lengths and the ability to insert breaks.

{% data reusables.projects.new-field %}
1. Select **Iteration**
1. To change the duration of each iteration, type a new number, then select the dropdown and click either **days** or **weeks**.
1. Click **Save**.

Specify an iteration for all items in your project.

### Creating a priority field

Now, create a custom field named `Priority` and containing the values: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.

{% data reusables.projects.new-field %}
1. Select **Single select**
1. Below "Options", type the first option, "High".
1. To add additional fields, for "Medium" and "Low", click **Add option**.
1. Click **Save**.

Specify a priority for all items in your project.

![Screenshot showing a list of issues, each with a priority of "Low," "Medium," or "High" in the "Priority" field.](/assets/images/help/projects/priority-example.png)

### Creating an estimate field

Create a custom field named `Estimate` to track the complexity for each item.

{% data reusables.projects.new-field %}
1. Select **Number**
1. Click **Save**.

Specify an estimate for all items in your project.

## Creating views

Create views to visualize your items in a table, board, and roadmap.

For more information on customizing views, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project).

### Creating a team backlog

You can use a table layout to visualize your team backlog as a spreadsheet, allowing you to view many fields and make edits.

Select visible fields for your view to communicate the priority and progress of your team backlog.

1. In table view, in the rightmost field header, click {% octicon "plus" aria-label="the plus icon" %}.

   ![Screenshot of a project. The "Add field" button, indicated by a plus icon, is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/new-field-button.png)

1. Under "Hidden fields", click {% ifversion issue-types %}**Type**, {% endif %}**Status**, {% ifversion sub-issues %}**Sub-issues progress**, {% endif %}**Assignees**, **Linked pull requests**, **Priority**, and **Estimate**.

Next, group all of the items in your project by priority to make it easier to focus on the high priority items.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "rows" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="rows" %} Group**.
1. Click **Priority**.

Now, move items between groups to change their priority.

1. Choose an item.
1. Drag and drop the item into a different priority group. When you do this, the priority of the item will change to be the priority of its new group.

You can also show the sum of the `Estimate` field for each priority group.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "number" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="number" %} Field sum**.
1. Select **Estimate**.

When you grouped your items by priority and added a field sum in the previous steps, your project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save these changes so that your collaborators will also see the tasks grouped by priority.

{% data reusables.projects.save-view %}

You can share the URL with your team to keep everyone aligned on the project priorities. When a view is saved, anyone who opens the project will see the saved view. Here, you grouped by priority, but you can also add other modifiers such as sort, filter, or layout.

Finally, to indicate the purpose of the view, give it a descriptive name.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="pencil" %} Rename view**.
1. Type the new name for your view.
1. To save changes, press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

Next, you will create new views with different layouts.

For more information on customizing tables, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout).

### Creating a weekly iteration board view

To view the progress of your project's items in a kanban board, you can use the board layout. The board layout is based on the status field by default, so specify a status for each item in your project.

First, create a new view.

{% data reusables.projects.new-view %}

Next, switch to the board layout.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Under "Layout", click **Board**.

To indicate the purpose of the view, give it a descriptive name.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="pencil" %} Rename view**.
1. Type the new name for your view.
1. To save changes, press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

Add a filter for `iteration:@current` to only includes items from the current iteration.

You can also show the sum of the `Estimate` field for each status column.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "number" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="number" %} Field sum**.
1. Select **Estimate**.

When you added a filter and added a field sum in the previous steps, your project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save this view so that you and your collaborators can easily access it in the future.

{% data reusables.projects.save-view %}

For more information on customizing boards, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout).

### Creating a team roadmap

To view your project items on a timeline, you can use the roadmap layout. Roadmaps use custom date and iteration fields to position your issues, pull requests, and draft items on a timeline, allowing you to track work over time and watch progress.

First, create a new view.

{% data reusables.projects.new-view %}

Next, switch to the roadmap layout.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Under "Layout", click **Roadmap**.

You can add vertical markers on a roadmap to show the milestones associated with items in your project.

1. In the top right of your roadmap, click **{% octicon "location" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="location" %} Markers**.

   ![Screenshot showing the menu bar in a roadmap layout. The "Markers" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/markers.png)

1. In the menu, select which markers you want to display on your roadmap.

When you added markers, your project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save this view so that you and your collaborators can easily access it in the future.

{% data reusables.projects.save-view %}

To indicate the purpose of the view, give it a descriptive name.

{% data reusables.projects.open-view-menu %}
1. Click **{% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="pencil" %} Rename view**.
1. Type the new name for your view.
1. To save changes, press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

For more information on customizing roadmaps, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-roadmap-layout).

## Configuring built-in automation

Next, configure the auto-add workflow to automatically add issues opened in a repository with a specific label to your project.

{% data reusables.projects.access-workflows %}
1. In the "Default workflows" list, click **Auto-add to project**.
1. To start editing the workflow, in the top right, click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot showing the workflow menu bar. The "Edit" button is highlighted with an orange rectangle.](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/workflow-start-editing.png)

1. Under "Filters", select the repository you want to add items from.
1. Next to the repository selection, type the filter criteria you want items to match before they are automatically added to your project. For example, to catch all issues and pull requests opened with the label "question", use `is:issue,pr label:question`.
1. To enable the new workflow, click **Save and turn on workflow**.

Finally, add a built in workflow to set the status to **Todo** when an item is added to your project.

1. In the top-right, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The menu icon" %} to open the menu.
   ![Screenshot showing a project's menu bar. The menu icon is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/projects-v2/open-menu.png)
1. In the menu, click **{% octicon "workflow" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="workflow" %} Workflows**.
1. Under **Default workflows**, click **Item added to project**.
1. Next to **When**, ensure that both `issues` and `pull requests` are selected.
1. Next to **Set**, select **Status:Todo**.
1. Click the **Disabled** toggle to enable the workflow.

For more information on automating your project and other default workflows you can configure to keep your project items up to date, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project).

## Viewing charts and insights

You can use insights for {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v2 %} to view, create, and customize charts that use the items added to your project as their source data. You can apply filters to the default chart and also create your own charts by choosing the grouping, layout, X-axis, and Y-axis configuration.

{% data reusables.projects.access-insights %}
1. In the menu on the left, click **New chart**.
1. Optionally, to change the name of the new chart, click {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-label="The triangle icon" %}, type a new name, and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.
1. Above the chart, type filters to change the data used to build the chart. See [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects).
1. To the right of the filter text box, click **Save changes**.

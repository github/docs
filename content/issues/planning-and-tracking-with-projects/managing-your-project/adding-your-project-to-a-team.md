## About adding projects to teams

You can add projects to your team to give the whole team collaborator access to their projects. When you add a project to a team, that project is listed on the team's projects page, making it easier for members to identify which projects a particular team uses.

Teams are granted read permissions on any project they are added to. This permission is added to existing permissions for the project and for individual team members, ensuring that any higher permissions are retained. For more information about setting permissions for teams and individual contributors, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects)."

{% data reusables.organizations.specific_team %}

1. Click **Link a project**.
1. In the search field, start typing the name of the project you want to add and then select the project in the list of matches.

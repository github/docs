A project is an adaptable collection of items that you can view as a table, a kanban board, or a roadmap and that stays up-to-date with {% data variables.product.company_short %} data. Your projects can track issues, pull requests, and ideas that you note down.

You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, and grouping issues and pull requests,{% ifversion projects-v2-insights %} visualize work with configurable charts,{% endif %} and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your teamâ€™s needs and processes.

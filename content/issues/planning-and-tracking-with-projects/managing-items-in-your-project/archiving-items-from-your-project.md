## Archiving items

You can archive an item to keep the context about the item in the project but remove it from the project views. You can also configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically archive items that meet certain criteria. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/archiving-items-automatically).

{% data reusables.projects.select-an-item %}
{% data reusables.projects.open-item-menu %}
1. Click **Archive**.
1. When prompted, confirm your choice by clicking **Archive**.

## Restoring archived items

1. Navigate to your project.
1. In the top-right, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More options" %}.

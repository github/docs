You can filter by your single select fields by specifying the option, for example: `fieldname:option`. You can filter for multiple values by providing a comma-separated list of options, for example: `fieldname:option,option`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects)."

Single select fields can contain up to 50 options.

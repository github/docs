You can use text fields to include notes or any other freeform text in your project.

Text fields can be used in filters, for example: `field:"exact text"`. Text fields and item titles will also be used if you filter for text without specifying a field.

Number fields can also be used in filters. You can use `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `..` range queries to filter by a number field. For example: `field:5..15` or `field:>=20`.

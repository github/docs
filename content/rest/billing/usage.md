The endpoints on this page return usage that is billed to the account associated with the endpoint. For help deciding which level of usage to report on, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/tutorials/automate-usage-reporting#step-1-decide-what-level-to-report-on).

* User endpoints return {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage that is billed directly to an individual user’s personal account. These endpoints are only applicable if the user has purchased their own {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plan.
* If a user’s {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license is managed and billed through an organization or enterprise, their usage is not included in user-level endpoints. In that case, you must use the organization- or enterprise-level endpoints instead.

{% ifversion fpt %}To view enterprise-level endpoints, select the dropdown menu at the top of the page and switch from Free, Pro, & Team to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.

{% else %}To view user- and organization-level endpoints, select the dropdown menu at the top of the page and switch from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} to Free, Pro, & Team.{% endif %}

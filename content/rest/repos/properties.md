## About custom properties

You can use the REST API to view the custom properties that were assigned to a repository by the organization that owns the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization)." For more information about the REST API endpoints to manage custom properties, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/properties)."

{% note %}

**Note:** The API endpoints for custom properties are in public beta and subject to change.

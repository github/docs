## About {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} supports a range of package managers for publishing packages. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages#supported-clients-and-formats)."

After you publish a package, you can use the REST API to manage the package in your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories and organizations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package)."

To use the REST API to manage {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, you must authenticate using a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %}.
- To access package metadata, your token must include the `read:packages` scope.
- To delete packages and package versions, your token must include the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes.
- To restore packages and package versions, your token must include the `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes.

If your package is in a registry that supports granular permissions, then your token does not need the `repo` scope to access or manage this package. If your package is in a registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, then your token must also include the `repo` scope since your package inherits permissions from a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository. For a list of registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

To access resources in an organization with SSO enabled, you must enable SSO for your {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)."

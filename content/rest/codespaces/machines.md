## About {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} machines

You can determine which machine types are available to create a codespace, either on a given repository or as an authenticated user. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/changing-the-machine-type-for-your-codespace#about-machine-types)."

You can also use this information when changing the machine of an existing codespace by updating its `machine` property. The machine update will take place the next time the codespace is restarted. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/changing-the-machine-type-for-your-codespace)."

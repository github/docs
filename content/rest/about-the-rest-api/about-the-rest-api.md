You can use {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s API to build scripts and applications that automate processes, integrate with {% data variables.product.company_short %}, and extend {% data variables.product.company_short %}. For example, you could use the API to triage issues, build an analytics dashboard, or manage releases.

Each REST API endpoint is documented individually, and the endpoints are categorized by the resource that they primarily affect. For example, you can find endpoints relating to issues in "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/issues)."

## Getting started with the REST API

**If you are new to REST APIs**, you may find it helpful to refer to the Quickstart or Getting Started guide for an introduction. For more information, see:

* "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/quickstart)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api)"

**If you are familiar with REST APIs** but new to {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s REST API, you may find it helpful to refer to the authentication documentation. For more information, see:

* "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api)"

**If you are building scripts or applications** that use the REST API, you may find some of the following guides helpful. For examples of scripting with the REST API, see:

* "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/scripting-with-the-rest-api-and-javascript)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/scripting-with-the-rest-api-and-ruby)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/writing-code-for-a-github-app/building-a-github-app-that-responds-to-webhook-events)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/writing-code-for-a-github-app/building-a-cli-with-a-github-app)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/automatically-redelivering-failed-deliveries-for-a-repository-webhook)"

For a list of libraries to facilitate scripting with the REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/libraries-for-the-rest-api)."

If you are building scripts or applications that use the REST API, you might also be interested in using webhooks to get notified about events or a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to access resources on behalf of a user or in an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/about-webhooks)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/deciding-when-to-build-a-github-app)."

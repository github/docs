## About code scanning

You can retrieve and update {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts from a repository. You can use the endpoints to create automated reports for the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts in an organization or upload analysis results generated using offline {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} tools. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning)."

### Custom media type for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

There is one supported custom media type for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} endpoints.

    application/sarif+json

You can use this with `GET` requests sent to the `/analyses/{analysis_id}` endpoint. For more information about this operation, see "[Get a {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} analysis for a repository](#get-a-code-scanning-analysis-for-a-repository)." When you use this media type with this operation, the response includes a subset of the actual data that was uploaded for the specified analysis, rather than the summary of the analysis that's returned when you use the default media type. The response also includes additional data such as the `github/alertNumber` and `github/alertUrl` properties. The data is formatted as [SARIF version 2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html).

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/media-types)."

You can use these endpoints to get a breakdown of aggregated metrics for various {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} features. The API includes:

* Data for the last 28 days
* Numbers of active users and engaged users
* Breakdowns by language and IDE
* The option to view metrics for an enterprise, organization, or team

If you currently use the [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-usage), we recommend migrating to these endpoints as soon as possible.

For help getting started, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/reviewing-activity-related-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization/analyzing-usage-over-time-with-the-copilot-metrics-api).

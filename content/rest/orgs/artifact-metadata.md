You can use these endpoints to upload storage and deployment records for software that your organization builds with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. The records are displayed on the organization's {% data variables.product.virtual_registry %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/concepts/supply-chain-security/linked-artifacts).

{% data reusables.code-scanning.beta %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} API lets you retrieve and update code scanning alerts from a repository. You can use the endpoints to create automated reports for the code scanning alerts in an organization or upload analysis results generated using offline code scanning tools. For more information, see "[Finding security vulnerabilities and errors in your code](/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code)."

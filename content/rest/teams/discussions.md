## About team discussions

You can use team discussions to have conversations that are not specific to a repository or project. Any member of the team's [organization](/rest/orgs) can create and read public discussion posts. For more details, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions)." To learn more about commenting on a discussion post, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/teams/discussion-comments)."

## About pre-receive hooks

These endpoints are only available to [authenticated](/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) site administrators. Normal users will receive a `404` response.

### Object attributes

#### Pre-receive Hook

| Name                             | Type      | Description                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                           | `string`  | The name of the hook.                                           |
| `script`                         | `string`  | The script that the hook runs.                                  |
| `script_repository`              | `object`  | The GitHub repository where the script is kept.                 |
| `environment`                    | `object`  | The pre-receive environment where the script is executed.       |
| `enforcement`                    | `string`  | The state of enforcement for this hook.                         |
| `allow_downstream_configuration` | `boolean` | Whether enforcement can be overridden at the org or repo level. |

Possible values for _enforcement_ are `enabled`, `disabled` and`testing`. `disabled` indicates the pre-receive hook will not run. `enabled` indicates it will run and reject
any pushes that result in a non-zero status. `testing` means the script will run but will not cause any pushes to be rejected.

## About LDAP

You can use these endpoints to update the Distinguished Name (DN) that a user or team maps to. Note that in most cases, you must have [LDAP Sync enabled](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap) for your {% data variables.product.product_name %} appliance. The "[Update LDAP mapping for a user](#update-ldap-mapping-for-a-user)" endpoint can be used when LDAP is enabled, even if LDAP Sync is disabled.

## About SCIM

{% ifversion ghec %}

{% data reusables.enterprise_user_management.about-scim-provisioning %} If you don't use a partner IdP with an existing integration, you can integrate using the following API endpoints. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/provisioning-user-accounts-for-enterprise-managed-users/provisioning-users-with-scim-using-the-rest-api)."

### Base URL

To manage your enterprise's users and groups using SCIM, use the following base URL to communicate with the endpoints in this category.

```http
{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/scim/v2/enterprises/{enterprise}/
```

### Authentication

To authenticate API requests, the person who configures SCIM on the IdP must use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} with `admin:enterprise` scope, which the IdP must provide in the request's `Authorization` header. For more information about {% data variables.product.pat_v1_plural %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)".

{% data variables.product.company_short %} recommends authenticating as the setup user for the enterprise. Other user accounts are created through SCIM, so authenticating as a different user could result in unintended consequences, such as getting locked out of your enterprise. Write requests to these APIs are possible through our published IdP applications, or through the beta of direct API access to our SCIM endpoints. If another enterprise owner needs to read information from the API, use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} with the `admin:enterprise` scope to make `GET` requests on your current SCIM implementation. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/provisioning-user-accounts-for-enterprise-managed-users/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-enterprise-managed-users#creating-a-personal-access-token)."

### Mapping of SAML and SCIM data

After a {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %} successfully authenticates to access your enterprise using SAML SSO, {% data variables.product.product_name %} links the user to a SCIM provisioned identity. To link the identities successfully, the SAML identity provider and the SCIM integration must use matching unique identifiers.

{% data variables.product.company_short %} requires the following SAML claim and SCIM attribute to successfully match the user with the identity provisioned by SCIM. Identity providers may differ in the field used to uniquely identify a user.

#### Microsoft Entra ID for SAML

To use Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) for SAML, the following SAML claims and SCIM attribute must match.

| SAML claim | Matching SCIM attribute |
| :- | :- |
| `http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier` | `externalId` |

#### Other IdPs for SAML

To use other IdPs for SAML, the following SAML claims and SCIM attribute must match.

| SAML claim | Matching SCIM attribute |
| :- | :- |
| `NameID` | `userName` |

### Supported SCIM user attributes

`Users` endpoints in this category support the following attributes within a request's parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `displayName` | String | Human-readable name for a user. |
| `name.formatted` | String | The user's full name, including all middle names, titles, and suffixes, formatted for display.|
| `name.givenName` | String | The first name of the user. |
| `name.familyName` | String | The last name of the user. |
| `userName` | String | The username for the user, generated by the SCIM provider. Undergoes [normalization](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/username-considerations-for-external-authentication#about-username-normalization) before being used. Must be unique per user. |
| `emails` | Array | List of the user's emails. |
| `roles` | Array | List of the user's roles. |
| `externalId` | String | This identifier is generated by a SCIM provider. Must be unique per user. |
| `id` | String | Identifier generated by the GitHub's SCIM endpoint. |
| `active` | Boolean | Indicates whether the identity is active (`true`) or should be suspended (`false`). |

### Supported SCIM group attributes

`Groups` endpoints in this category support the following attributes within a request's parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `displayName` | String | Human-readable name for a group. |
| `members` | String | List of members who are assigned to the group in SCIM provider |
| `externalId` | String | This identifier is generated by a SCIM provider. Must be unique per user. |

{% ifversion ghes %}

{% data reusables.scim.ghes-beta-note %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.enterprise-admin-api-classic-pat-only %}

{% data variables.product.product_name %} provides endpoints for use by SCIM-enabled Identity Providers (IdPs). An integration on the IdP can use the REST API to automatically provision, manage, or deprovision user accounts on a {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO) for authentication. For more information about SAML SSO, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/about-saml-for-enterprise-iam)."

These endpoints are based on SCIM 2.0. For more information, refer to your IdP's documentation or see the [specification on the IETF website](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644).

### Root URLs

An IdP can use the following root URL to communicate with the endpoints in this category for a {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance.

```http
{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/scim/v2/
```

Endpoints in this category are case-sensitive. For example, the first letter in the `Users` endpoint must be capitalized.

```shell
GET /scim/v2/Users/{scim_user_id}
```

### Authentication

The SCIM integration on the IdP performs actions on behalf of an enterprise owner for the {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owners)."

To authenticate API requests, the person who configures SCIM on the IdP must use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} with `admin:enterprise` scope, which the IdP must provide in the request's `Authorization` header. For more information about {% data variables.product.pat_v1_plural %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)".

{% note %}

**Note:** Enterprise owners must generate and use a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} for authentication of requests to endpoints in this category. {% ifversion ghes %}{% data variables.product.pat_v2_caps %} and {% endif %}GitHub app callers are not supported at this time.

{% endnote %}

### Mapping of SAML and SCIM data

The {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance links each user who authenticates successfully with SAML SSO to a SCIM identity. To link the identities successfully, the SAML IdP and the SCIM integration must use matching SAML `NameID` and SCIM `userName` values for each user.

{% ifversion ghes %}
{% note %}

**Note:** If the {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses Entra ID as a SAML IdP, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will also check the SCIM `externalId` claim and SAML `http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier` claim to match users first, instead of using `NameID` and `userName`.

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

### Supported SCIM user attributes

`User` endpoints in this category support the following attributes within a request's parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| `displayName` | String | Human-readable name for a user. |
| `name.formatted` | String | The user's full name, including all middle names, titles, and suffixes, formatted for display.
| `name.givenName` | String | The first name of the user. |
| `name.familyName` | String | The last name of the user. |
| `userName` | String | The username for the user, generated by the IdP. Undergoes [normalization](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/username-considerations-for-external-authentication#about-username-normalization) before being used.
| `emails` | Array | List of the user's emails. |
| `roles` | Array | List of the user's roles. |
| `externalId` | String | This identifier is generated by an IdP provider. You can find the `externalId` for a user either on the IdP, or by using the [List SCIM provisioned identities](#list-scim-provisioned-identities-for-an-enterprise) endpoint and filtering on other known attributes, such as a user's username or email address on the {% data variables.product.product_name %} instance. |
| `id` | String | Identifier generated by the instance's SCIM endpoint. |
| `active` | Boolean | Indicates whether the identity is active (`true`) or should be suspended (`false`). |

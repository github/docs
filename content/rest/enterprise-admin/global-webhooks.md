To learn how to configure global webhooks, see [About global webhooks](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity/managing-global-webhooks).

Global webhooks are automatically installed on your enterprise. You can use global webhooks to automatically monitor, respond to, or enforce rules for users, organizations, teams, and repositories on your enterprise.

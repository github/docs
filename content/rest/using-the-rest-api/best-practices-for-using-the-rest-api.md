{% note %}

**Note**: Rate limits are only enabled for your instance if your site administrator has enabled them. Even if rate limits are disabled for your instance, you may still want to follow the best practices that are intended to help you avoid exceeding the rate limit. This can help reduce load on your servers.

{% endnote %}

## Avoid polling

You should subscribe to webhook events instead of polling the API for data. This will help your integration stay within the API rate limit. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks)."

## Make authenticated requests

Authenticated requests have a higher primary rate limit than unauthenticated requests. To avoid exceeding the rate limit, you should make authenticated requests. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api)."

## Avoid concurrent requests

To avoid exceeding secondary rate limits, you should make requests serially instead of concurrently. To achieve this, you can implement a queue system for requests.

## Pause between mutative requests

If you are making a large number of `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` requests, wait at least one second between each request. This will help you avoid secondary rate limits.

## Handle rate limit errors appropriately

If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:

* If the `retry-after` response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
* If the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header is `0`, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the `x-ratelimit-reset` header. The `x-ratelimit-reset` header is in UTC epoch seconds.
* Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.

## Follow redirects

The {% data variables.product.product_name %} REST API uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. You should assume that any
request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is not an error, and you should follow the redirect.

A `301` status code indicates permanent redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the `location` header. Additionally, you should update your code to use this URL for future requests.

A `302` or `307` status code indicates temporary redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the `location` header. However, you should not update your code to use this URL for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with HTTP specifications.

## Do not manually parse URLs

Many API endpoints return URL values for fields in the response body. You should not try to parse these URLs or to predict the structure of future URLs. This can cause your integration to break if {% data variables.product.company_short %} changes the structure of the URL in the future. Instead, you should look for a field that contains the information that you need. For example, the endpoint to create an issue returns an `html_url` field with a value like `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/issues/1347` and a `number` field with a value like `1347`. If you need to know the number of the issue, use the `number` field instead of parsing the `html_url` field.

Similarly, you should not try to manually construct pagination queries. Instead, you should use the link headers to determine what pages of results you can request. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

## Use conditional requests if appropriate

Most endpoints return an `etag` header, and many endpoints return a `last-modified` header. You can use the values of these headers to make conditional requests. If the response has not changed, you will receive a `304 Not Modified` response. Making a conditional request does not count against your primary rate limit if a `304` response is returned.

For example, if a previous request returned an `etag` header value of `644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730`, you can use the `if-none-match` header in a future request:

```shell
curl {% data variables.product.rest_url %}/meta --include --header 'if-none-match: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"'
```

For example, if a previous request returned a `last-modified` header value of `Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT`, you can use the `if-modified-since` header in a future request:

```shell
curl {% data variables.product.rest_url %}/repos/github/docs --include --header 'if-modified-since: Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT'
```

## Do not ignore errors

You should not ignore repeated `4xx` and `5xx` error codes. Instead, you should ensure that you are correctly interacting with the API. For example, if an endpoint requests a string and you are passing it a numeric value, you will receive a validation error. Similarly, attempting to access an unauthorized or nonexistent endpoint will result in a `4xx` error.

Intentionally ignoring repeated validation errors may result in the suspension of your app for abuse.

Issue events are triggered by activity in issues and pull requests and are available in the REST API for [Issue events](/rest/issues/events) and [Timeline events](/rest/issues/timeline). Each event type specifies whether the event is available in the REST API for issue events or timeline events.

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request to be an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, the Issue Events and Timeline Events endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. Pull requests have a `pull_request` property in the `issue` object. Because pull requests are issues, issue and pull request numbers do not overlap in a repository. For example, if you open your first issue in a repository, the number will be 1. If you then open a pull request, the number will be 2. Each event type specifies if the event occurs in pull request, issues, or both.

## Issue event object common properties

Issue events all have the same object structure, except events that are only available in the REST API for timeline events. Some events also include additional properties that provide more context about the event resources. Refer to the specific event for details about any properties that differ from this object format.

## About Git trees

A Git tree object creates the hierarchy between files in a Git repository. You can use the Git tree object to create the relationship between directories and the files they contain. These endpoints allow you to read and write [tree objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#_tree_objects) to your Git database on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

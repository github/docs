# REST

The `/content/rest` directory is where the GitHub REST API docs live!

* The `/content/rest/guides` and `/content/rest/overview` directories contain regular articles. These are human-editable.
* The `/content/rest/reference` directory contains an article for each group of endpoints in the GitHub REST API. Most of the content in this directory is rendered using `include` tags.

  The content rendered by `include` tags is sourced from the `/src/rest/data` directory, which is automatically generated from the API source code internally in GitHub, and should not be edited by a human. For more information, see the [`/src/rest/README.md`](/src/rest/README.md).

  **We cannot accept changes to content that is rendered by `include` tags. However, you can open an issue describing the changes you would like to see.**

## About {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace)."

These endpoints allow you to see which customers are using a pricing plan, see a customer's purchases, and see if an account has an active subscription.

### Testing with stubbed endpoints

You can [test your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/testing-your-app) with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is hard-coded, fake data that will not change based on actual subscriptions.

To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether the API logic succeeds before listing {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

Make sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}.

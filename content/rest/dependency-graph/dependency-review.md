## About dependency review

You can use the REST API to view dependency changes, and the security impact of these changes, before you add them to your environment. You can view the diff of dependencies between two commits of a repository, including vulnerability data for any version updates with known vulnerabilities. For more information about dependency review, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)."

## About dependency submissions

{% data reusables.dependency-submission.about-dependency-submission %}

You can submit dependencies in the form of a snapshot. A snapshot is a set of dependencies associated with a commit SHA and other metadata, that reflects the current state of your repository for a commit.  You can choose to use pre-made actions or create your own actions to submit your dependencies in the required format each time your project is built. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)."

You can submit multiple sets of dependencies to be included in your dependency graph. The REST API uses the `job.correlator` property and the `detector.name` category of the snapshot to ensure the latest submissions for each workflow get shown. The `correlator` property itself is the primary field you will use to keep independent submissions distinct. An example `correlator` could be a simple combination of two variables available in actions runs: `<GITHUB_WORKFLOW> <GITHUB_JOB>`.

## About self-hosted runner groups in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

You can use the REST API to manage groups of self-hosted runners in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups)."

{% data reusables.actions.actions-authentication %} {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} must have the `administration` permission for repositories or the `organization_self_hosted_runners` permission for organizations. Authenticated users must have admin access to repositories or organizations, or the `manage_runners:enterprise` scope for enterprises to use these endpoints.

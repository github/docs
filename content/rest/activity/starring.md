## About starring

You can use the REST API to star (bookmark) a repository. Stars are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest. Stars have no effect on notifications or the activity feed. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars)."

### Starring versus watching

In August 2012, we [changed the way watching
works](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. Some API
client applications may still be using the original "watcher" endpoints for accessing
this data. You should now use the "star" endpoints instead (described
below). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/activity/watching)" and the [changelog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2012-09-05-watcher-api/).

In responses from the REST API, `watchers`, `watchers_count`, and `stargazers_count` correspond to the number of users that have starred a repository, whereas `subscribers_count` corresponds to the number of watchers.

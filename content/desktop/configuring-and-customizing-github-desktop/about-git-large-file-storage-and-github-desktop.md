When you install {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}, {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}) is installed, too. {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} lets you push files to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} that exceed the normal limit of {% data variables.large_files.max_github_size %}. For more information about {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)."

To use {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}, you must configure {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} using the command line. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage)."

After you configure {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} to track files in a repository, you can seamlessly access and manage large files with {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} like any other file in the repository.

title: Working with your remote repository on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
intro: 'As you make changes to your project locally, you can keep them up-to-date with your remote repository. In Git, a *remote* is the server where your code is stored. In your case, that server is a repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}.'

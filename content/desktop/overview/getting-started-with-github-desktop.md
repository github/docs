For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request-from-github-desktop)."''

You can view your own or your collaborator's pull requests in {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}. Viewing a pull request in {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} lets you see any proposed changes and make additional changes by opening the project's files and repositories in your default text editor. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/viewing-a-pull-request-in-github-desktop)."

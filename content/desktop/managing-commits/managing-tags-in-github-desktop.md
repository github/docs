## About tags in {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} allows you to create annotated tags. Tags are associated with commits, so you can use a tag to mark an individual point in your repository's history, including a version number for a release. For more information about release tags, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)."

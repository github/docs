GitHub does not allow any content or conduct on GitHub that furthers terrorism or violent extremism (TVE). We will remove content and may ban accounts affiliated with TVE groups or individuals. You may not use GitHub for activities including but not limited to:

* Organizing, inciting, planning, coordinating, or calling for violence, attacks, or other illegal harm
* Recruiting, promoting, or encouraging others to join or support TVE groups
* Financing, soliciting funds, or providing other support for a TVE group
* Sharing propaganda, manifestos, or any other media intended to praise or spread TVE ideology
* Glorification or praise of TVE groups or acts
* Displaying symbols, logos, slogans, or any other insignia associated with TVE groups in a manner that endorses or supports them
* Posting code, scripts, guides, or instructions that facilitate TVE activities

GitHub may use automated tools, such as hash matching, as well as human review to detect and remove TVE content. If we become aware of credible evidence that a user is involved in TVE activities outside of GitHub (for example, being part of a legally designated terrorist organization or engaging in extremist violence), we may suspend or terminate that user’s GitHub account to protect the community and may take additional action, such as reporting to law enforcement authorities.

We recognize there may be exceptional cases where content related to terrorism or extremism appears on GitHub for legitimate reasons — for instance, in academic research, training data, journalism, or counter-terrorism efforts. Such content must be kept to a minimum, clearly placed in an appropriate context (educational, documentary, or critical), and not in any way support extremist causes. Even with context, GitHub may restrict or remove this content if we determine it could be misused or poses a risk.

If you encounter any content that you believe violates this policy, please report it immediately using our [Reporting Abuse](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) instructions.

**Short version:** _We host a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the Service, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policies, which include some restrictions on content and conduct on GitHub related to user safety, intellectual property, privacy, authenticity, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other._

Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Acceptable Use Policies have the meanings assigned to them in your main agreement with us — the [GitHub Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the [GitHub Corporate Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-corporate-terms-of-service) or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. For customers subject to the legacy Corporate Terms of Service, "you" and "your" refer to "Customer" or "Users". "We", "us", and "our" refer to "GitHub".

- incentivized by (or incentivizes inauthentic engagement with) rewards such as cryptocurrency airdrops, tokens, credits, gifts or other give-aways.

## 5. Site Access and Safety

We do not allow content or activity on GitHub that:

- directly supports [unlawful active attack or malware campaigns](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-active-malware-or-exploits) that are causing technical harms — such as using our platform to deliver malicious executables or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers — with no implicit or explicit dual-use purpose prior to the abuse occurring; or

Please note, activities permitted under bug bounty programs, such as the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com), are not considered “unauthorized,” but must only affect the organization whose bug bounty program authorized the activity.

## 6. Services Usage Limits

You will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without our express written permission.

## 7. Information Usage Restrictions

You may use information from our Service for the following reasons, regardless of whether the information was scraped, collected through our API, or obtained otherwise:

- Researchers may use public, non-personal information from the Service for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access).
- Archivists may use public information from the Service for archival purposes.

Scraping refers to extracting information from our Service via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. Scraping does not refer to the collection of information through our API. Please see Section H of our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#h-api-terms) for our API Terms.

You may not use information from the Service (whether scraped, collected through our API, or obtained otherwise) for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

Your use of information from the Service must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## 8. Privacy

Misuse of personal information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), particularly in regards to the collection of personal information. If you collect any personal information from the Service, you agree that you will only use that personal information for the purpose for which that User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any personal information you have gathered from the Service, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from us or other users.

## 9. Excessive Bandwidth Use

The Service's bandwidth limitations vary based on the features you use. If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other users of similar features, we reserve the right to suspend your Account, throttle your file hosting, or otherwise limit your activity until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption. We also reserve the right—after providing advance notice—to delete repositories that we determine to be placing undue strain on our infrastructure. For guidance on acceptable use of object storage in repositories, refer to "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github)". For more details on specific features' bandwidth limitations, see the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## 10. Advertising on GitHub

**Short version:** _We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that._

While we understand that you may want to promote your Content by posting supporters' names or logos in your Account, the primary focus of the Content posted in or through your Account to the Service should not be advertising or promotional marketing. This includes Content posted in or through Pages, Packages, repositories, and all other parts of the Service. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents or project description sections associated with your Account, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in other Users' Accounts, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.

You may not promote or distribute content or activity that is illegal or otherwise prohibited by our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) or [Acceptable Use Policies](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), including excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), get-rich-quick schemes, and misrepresentation or deception related to your promotion.

If you decide to post any promotional materials in your Account, you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials. We reserve the right to remove any promotional materials or advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.

## 11. User Protection

You must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users.

We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole.

GitHub does not allow any projects that are designed for, encourage, promote, support, or suggest in any way the use of large language models or any other synthetic or manipulated media tools for the creation of:

* Sexual material involving minors or any other content that would constitute [Child Sexual Abuse Material](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-child-sexual-exploitation-or-abuse) under our policies
* Violent extremist propaganda or any other content that would constitute [Terrorist or Violent Extremist Content](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-terrorism-and-violent-extremism) under our policies
* Sexually explicit media of people without their consent or any other content that would constitute [Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-non-consensual-intimate-imagery) under our policies

GitHub evaluates violations of this policy by examining a project in context. This could include an evaluation of many factors: how a project is configured; how it is marketed; the information provided in its README or other documentation; the external sites or resources it links to; the nature of support provided by the project maintainers; or any other relevant facts that indicate a likelihood of furthering one of the prohibited uses above.

GitHub does not tolerate the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). This includes, but is not limited to:

* Private or intimate images or videos shared without the consent of all individuals depicted
* Threats to share intimate images or videos
* Sexually suggestive images or videos of a person taken in a private setting without their knowledge or consent such as upskirting, hidden cameras, or other forms of voyeurism
* Digitally altered or synthetic media that depicts a realistic-looking individual in a sexually explicit manner without their consent

We understand that there may be rare cases in which such content may be shared for legitimate purposes, such as news reporting, education, or in a human rights context. However, we will review such cases on a case-by-case basis and may make exceptions when the content is not gratuitous and serves a clear public interest.

If you encounter any content that you believe violates this policy, please report it immediately using our [Reporting Abuse](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) instructions.

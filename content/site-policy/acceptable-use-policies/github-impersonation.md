You may not misrepresent your identity or your association with another person or organization. This includes doing any of the following in a way that misleads or deceives others:

* Copying another user's avatar or other personal profile information
* Posting content under another user's email address
* Using a deceptively similar username, organization name, or other namespace
* Accessing an account or organization with another user's token or credentials
* Otherwise posing as another individual or organization

Impersonation is a form of harassment and violation of this policy may lead to loss of access to your account.

Please note, having a username similar to another is not necessarily impersonation. GitHub will take context into account. For example, as in cases involving claims of [misinformation or disinformation](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-misinformation-and-disinformation), we generally allow parody and satire that is in line with our [Acceptable Use Policies](/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

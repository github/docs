GitHub does not allow any content or conduct on GitHub that exploits, harms, or endangers children, and we have a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation or abuse material (CSAM). This means you may not engage in activities including but not limited to:

* Uploading, linking to, or otherwise distributing or promoting CSAM
* Depicting sexualized minors in any form, including textual fantasies, cartoons or drawings, simulations, or AI-generated content
* Soliciting or advertising CSAM or services involving the exploitation of children
* Engaging in or facilitating child grooming, sextortion, or trafficking of minors
* Glorifying, praising, supporting, or instructing in the abuse of children

GitHub may use automated tools, such as hash matching, as well as human review to detect and remove CSAM. GitHub will swiftly remove any such content once identified and may take additional action, including account suspension and reporting illegal activity to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children or other law enforcement authorities.

If you encounter any content that you believe violates this policy, please report it immediately using our [Reporting Abuse](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) instructions.

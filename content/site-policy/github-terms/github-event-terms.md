By RSVP'ing to or attending a GitHub event, including any of the events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the GitHub event (collectively the "Event"), you represent that you have read, understand, and agree to the following GitHub Event Terms (hereinafter “Event Terms”).

## 1. Basic requirements to attend - including the Event Code of Conduct

In order to participate in the Event, you represent that

* You have the requisite capacity and authority to enter into these Event Terms;
* You have read and understood these Event Terms and the [AUTOTITLE](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service);
* You agree to abide by the [Event Code of Conduct](/site-policy/github-terms/github-event-code-of-conduct); and
* If alcohol is being served at the Event, you are at least 21 years old or over the legal drinking age at the location where the Event is being held.

If asked to stop behavior deemed harassing or prohibited, you must comply immediately. If you violate the [Event Code of Conduct](/site-policy/github-terms/github-event-code-of-conduct) or these Event Terms, the Event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate in their discretion, including warnings or expulsion from the Event with no refund. You must at all times obey the instructions or directions of the Event organizers.

## 2. Pictures and videos

GitHub and its partners, agents, or contractors sometimes take photos and videos at the Event. By participating or attending the Event, you agree that you may appear in some of these photos and videos, and you authorize GitHub's use of them during and after the Event.

Additionally, if you take any photos or videos at the Event and provide them to GitHub, you authorize us to use them in the same fashion, and represent that the individuals that appear in your photos and videos have consented to such use.

## 3. Information sharing

Event sponsors, exhibitors, and other third parties may directly request your personal or other information at their exhibit booths, auxiliary events, or presentations. Providing any  information to them is voluntary and optional, and you should review their privacy policies to determine how they will treat your personal information and whether you are comfortable with that treatment.

If during the event you provide your information to a sponsor, exhibitor, or third party, including but not limited to (1) RSVPing or attending a session or program hosted by a third party other than GitHub, (2) presenting your badge for scanning at an exhibitor booth or breakout session, (3) requesting that a sponsor contact you via their virtual page on githubuniverse.com, or (4) entering a raffle, sweepstakes, or promotional event put on by third party other than GitHub, you understand and agree that your information will go to a non-GitHub entity and GitHub takes no responsibility for how that company uses or processes your personal information.  You should review their privacy policies to determine how they will treat your personal information and whether you are comfortable with that treatment.

Event sponsors and exhibitors are required to comply with GitHub’s privacy requirements and all applicable law including protecting Personal Data from unauthorized use, access or disclosure.

## 4. Risk, liability, and indemnity

### Assumption of risk

Although we try to create a safe environment at the Event, we cannot guarantee 100% safety for participants. Please do your part to help reduce your chance of being injured at the Event.

You agree to carefully consider the risks inherent in any activities you choose to take part in at the Event and to take reasonable precautions before you choose to attend or participate at the Event. You are responsible for your own actions and any resulting consequences. You agree to assume responsibility for your actions and your attendance to the fullest extent permitted by law.  GitHub is not responsible for any injuries or accidents that you might sustain at the Event.

### Release of liability

You (for yourself, your heirs, personal representatives, or assigns, and anyone else who could make a claim on your behalf) hereby release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue GitHub and its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, agents, employees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, or expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to your attendance at the Event. This release will not apply if GitHub is grossly negligent or engages in willful misconduct.

### Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold GitHub, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives harmless, including costs, liabilities, and legal fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to, related to, or connected with your attendance or conduct at the Event.

## 5. Termination

GitHub reserves the right to revoke your permission to attend the Event or to otherwise prohibit or limit your attendance at the Event for any or no reason, without notice or liability of any kind. The entirety of Section 4 of these Event Terms will continue to apply if your participation at the Event is terminated.

## 6. Choice of law and venue

California law will govern these Event Terms, as well as any claim, cause of action or dispute that might arise between you and GitHub (a "Claim"), without regard to conflict of law provisions. FOR ANY CLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

## 7. Miscellaneous terms

You agree that you will not represent yourself as an employee, representative, or agent of GitHub (unless, of course, you are actually employed by GitHub).

We reserve the right to cancel the Event or any related event at any time, for any reason, and without liability or prejudice.

Any failure by GitHub to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Event Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

The views expressed by any event attendee, speaker, exhibitor, or sponsor are not necessarily those of GitHub. All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, and sponsors are solely responsible for the content of all presentations and any other material used at the Event.

GitHub reserves the right to update these Event Terms in its sole discretion and without prior notice. These Event Terms apply to all event participants (attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, staff, and crew).  You are advised to review these Event Terms periodically.

These Event Terms were last updated on February 7th 2024.

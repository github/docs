## Code of Conduct

By attending a GitHub event, including any of the events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the GitHub event (collectively the "Event"), you represent that you have read, understand, and agree to the following GitHub Event Code of Conduct (hereinafter “Code of Conduct”).  This Code of Conduct applies to all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, sponsors, organizers, staff, and volunteers (collectively “Event Participants”) at the Event.

GitHub values the participation of all Event Participants and aims to create an event where all Event Participants have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all Event Participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other Event Participants throughout the Event.

GitHub is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience.

We do not tolerate harassment of Event Participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to an Event Participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication and behavior should be appropriate for a professional setting including people of many different backgrounds.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for everyone at the Event
* Showing empathy towards others and Event Participants

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments or behavior
* Personal or political attacks toward Event Participants
* Sustained disruption of talks or any other events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the Event
* Intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing of Event Participants
* Photography or recording of Event Participants without their consent
* Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Each Event Participant is entirely responsible for their own actions.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

## Reporting an incident

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, have any other concerns, or if you believe an Event Participant is not acting in a way compliant with this Code of Conduct, please speak directly with a venue security officer or GitHub employee for urgent help, or email us at [events@github.com](mailto:events@github.com) for non-urgent issues. For life threatening situations, please dial 911 immediately.

GitHub employees will be happy to help Event Participants contact security or local law enforcement, escort to safety, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the Event.

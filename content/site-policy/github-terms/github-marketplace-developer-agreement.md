## 2.	PURPOSE AND LICENSE GRANT

**2.1**	This Agreement sets forth the terms that govern a Developer publishing Listings on GitHub Marketplace for End Users to use Developer Products. This Agreement is applicable to all Developer Products, regardless if distributed for free or for a fee.  Developer agrees to use the GitHub Marketplace solely for the purposes permitted by this Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for its Developer Products.

**2.2**	Developer grants to GitHub a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license  to process the Listing in any fashion (including testing and displaying it on Marketplace), and to display Developer’s Brand Features in connection with Marketplace.

**2.3**	In addition to the licenses granted above, GitHub may include Developer Brand Features in any material marketing Marketplace.  If Developer stops distributing a Developer Product on Marketplace, GitHub will stop use of the discontinued products’ Brand Features.

**2.4**	Developer must include a separate end user license agreement (“EULA”) in its Developer Products that will govern the End User’s rights to the Developer Products.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that the applicable EULA for each Developer Product is solely between Developer and the End User.  GitHub shall not be responsible, nor have any liability whatsoever, under any EULA.

**2.5**	Except for the license rights granted in this Agreement, (a) Developer retains all rights in the Developer Products; (b) each party retains all rights it has independent of this Agreement, including rights under the US Copyright Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions; and (c) each party owns all rights, title and interest in its respective Brand Features.  Each party is responsible for protecting and enforcing its own rights and neither party has an obligation to do so on the other’s behalf.

**2.6**	GitHub shall be entitled to provide Developer’s name, address and other contact details to any third party as required by law or that reasonably, in GitHub’s sole determination, claims that Developer does not possess all of the necessary intellectual property rights in or to the Developer Products.

## 3.	RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Notwithstanding any of the requirements set forth in Section 2 (Purpose and License Grant) above, Developer's use of Marketplace is explicitly conditioned on Developer’s adherence to this Agreement, including the restrictions and compliance requirements set forth below.

**3.1**	Developer agrees it will protect the privacy and legal rights of all End Users with respect to the use of Developer Products.  If an End User provides Developer with, or the Developer Product otherwise collects, discloses, accesses or uses, End User Personal Data, then the Developer must (a) inform End Users that such information will be available to the Developer Products; (b) provide a legally adequate privacy notice and protection to End Users; (c) obtain valid End User consent as required, and (d) comply with all other data privacy obligations applicable to Developer.

**3.2**	In order to use and access a GitHub API, Developer must obtain a Token by becoming a subscriber. Developer may not share its Token with any third party, shall keep its Token and all login information secure, and shall use the Token as Developer’s sole means of accessing a GitHub API.

Additionally, Developer will not attempt to distribute any Developer Product that:

* 1\. Contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system);
* 2\. Enables the unauthorized download of streaming content or media; or
* 3\. Diverts End Users or provides links to any other site that mimics Marketplace or passes itself off as Marketplace

**3.4** With respect to Developer Products that interact with generative AI technology, including GitHub Copilot Extensions, Developer will:

* 1\. Test the Developer Product using various inputs to ensure that outputs do not violate this Agreement;
* 2\. Notify users when they are interacting with generative AI content;
* 3\. Have a mechanism for End Users to report feedback to GitHub and Developer related to errors, bugs, improper, or undesired outputs; and
* 4\. Inform End Users the appropriate use cases, best practices, and limitations of the Developer Product.
  
**3.5**	Developer shall not by any means repackage or resell Marketplace, a GitHub API, Personal Data, or Usage Data. Developer is not permitted to use a GitHub API or any Personal Data or Usage Data in any manner that does or could undermine the security of the Service, a GitHub API, Usage Data or any other data or information stored or transmitted using Marketplace. In addition, Developer shall not (a) interfere with, modify or disable any features, functionality or security controls of  Marketplace or a GitHub API; (b) circumvent in any fashion any protection mechanisms for Marketplace or a GitHub API; or (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organizational form from Marketplace or a GitHub API.

## 4.	TAKEDOWNS

**4.1**	Your Takedowns. Upon providing GitHub with thirty (30) days written notice, you may remove your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace. You must continue to comply with this Agreement for any Listing already distributed through Marketplace including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of End Users who have previously purchased or installed your Listing or (b) change your obligation to deliver or support Listing that has been previously purchased or installed by users. If you remove your Listing, GitHub will not disclose your reason for the removal.

**4.2**	GitHub Review and Takedowns. GitHub may review or test your Listing for compliance with this Agreement, GitHub ToS, and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations. GitHub retains sole and absolute discretion over what Listings are included on Marketplace. You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for Marketplace, or as part of your continued use of Marketplace. You agree that any information you give to Marketplace will be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the specification for your Listing, GitHub may ask that you include in the file for your Listing information such as your name and email address. GitHub may use this information when featuring the Listing in our directory or for other uses.

If GitHub is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines, in its sole discretion, that a Listing or any portion thereof or your Brand Features:

* (a) violates the terms of this Agreement or the ToS;
* (b) the display of the Listing is impacting the integrity of GitHub servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience difficulty);
* (c) is deemed by GitHub to add undue risk to Marketplace End Users’ data or impair the user experience of Marketplace or GitHub; or
* (d) is subject to End User complaints in regards to your breach of your EULA,

GitHub may: suspend the transfer of Personal Data to your Developer Product; prohibit the collection and processing of Personal Data via your Developer Product; remove the Listing from Marketplace; flag, filter, or modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata); or reclassify the Listing at its sole discretion. If GitHub takes any of these actions on your Listing, you may appeal GitHub's action through the [GitHub Appeal and Reinstatement Process](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement)

**4.3**	Developer Product Updates. From time to time, GitHub may check for available updates to any Listing, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you update your Listing to Marketplace, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.  GitHub makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. Updates to a Listing are subject to the same terms and conditions as the Listing.

**4.4**	End-User Takedowns. If an End-User uses your Developer Product in a way that violates the Terms, then we have the right to suspend or terminate that End-User's access to the Developer Product without any liability to you.

## 5.	REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

**5.1**	Developer must inform End Users of the Personal Data that will be transmitted to the Developer Application from the Service and that Developer terms will control the privacy, security or integrity of such Personal Data. To the extent Developer’s Applications store, process or transmit Personal Data, neither Developer nor Developer’s Application will, without appropriate prior user consent or except to the extent required by applicable law,

”**Add-On Software**” means Advanced Security, Insights, Learning Lab for Enterprise Server and other additional Software add-on products that GitHub may offer from time to time.

“**Advanced Security**” means the Software feature which enables Customer to identify security vulnerabilities through customizable and automated semantic code analysis.

"**Agreement Effective Date**" is the earlier of the date that Customer either clicks "I Agree" to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or that it first places an order for the Products.

"**Affiliate**" means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party where "control" means having more than fifty percent (50%) ownership or the right to direct the management of the entity.

"**Beta Previews** means software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.

"**Customer**" means the company or organization that has entered into this Agreement with GitHub by clicking on the "I AGREE" or similar button or by accessing the Products.

"**Customer Modifications**" means Software modifications Customer may make solely for the purpose of developing bug fixes, customizations, or additional features to any libraries licensed under open source licenses that may be included with or linked to by the Software.

"**Documentation**" means any manuals, documentation and other supporting materials related to the Software that GitHub provides or makes available to Customer. Documentation is considered part of the Software.

"**Feedback**" means any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback on GitHub products or services.

**2. Software License Grant.** GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to install and use the Software for Customer’s internal business purposes during the applicable Subscription Term, in accordance with the Documentation, and only for the number of Subscription Licenses stated in Customer’s Order Form. The Software includes components licensed to GitHub by third parties, including software whose licenses require GitHub to make the source code for those components available. The source code for such components will be provided upon request. Without limiting the foregoing, this license permits Customer to download and run Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition container image for Linux files (“**SQL Server Images**”), which may be used only with the Software as documented. Customer’s right to use the SQL Server Images ends when Customer no longer has rights to use the Software, and Customer must uninstall the SQL Server Images when its right to use them ends. Microsoft Corporation may disable SQL Server Images at any time.

**3. License Restrictions.** Except as expressly permitted by law or by applicable third-party license, Customer and its Affiliates must not and must not allow any third party to: (i) sublicense, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, or redistribute the Software; (ii) host the Software for the benefit of third parties; (iii) disclose or permit any third party to access the Software, except as expressly permitted in Section 2; (iv) hack or modify the License Key, or avoid or change any license registration process; (v) except for Customer Modifications, modify or create derivative works of the Software, or merge the Software with other software; (vi) disassemble, decompile, bypass any code obfuscation, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to derive any of its source code, in whole or in part; (vii) modify, obscure, or delete any proprietary rights notices included in or on the Software or Documentation; or (viii) otherwise use or copy the Software or Documentation in a manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement.

**4. Intellectual Property Rights.** As between the Parties, GitHub owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products. GitHub reserves all rights in and to the Products not expressly granted to Customer under this Agreement.

**5. Feedback.** Customer may provide Feedback to GitHub regarding the Products. Feedback is voluntary and is not Customer Confidential Information, even if designated as such. GitHub may fully exercise and exploit such Feedback for the purpose of (i) improving the operation, functionality and use of GitHub’s existing and future product offerings and commercializing such offerings; and (ii) publishing aggregated statistics about the quality of the Products, provided that no data in any such publication will be used to specifically identify Customer, its employees or Customer’s proprietary software code.

**6. Subscription Licenses.** Subscription Licenses are granted on a per User basis and multiple Users may not use the same Subscription License. Customer may reassign a Subscription License to a new User only after ninety (90) days from the last reassignment of that same Subscription License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the User’s employment or contract, or (iii) temporary reallocation of Subscription Licenses to cover a User’s absence. When Customer reassigns a Subscription License from one User to another, Customer must block the former User’s access to the Subscription License.

**7. Affiliates.** Customer’s Affiliates are authorized to use the Software in accordance with this Agreement, so long as Customer remains fully responsible for their access and use of the Software.

**8. Payment**

**8.1** _Fees._ Customer agrees to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. Customer must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections 13 and 14.1. If Customer fails to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. Customer is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

**8.2** _Purchasing Additional Subscription Licenses._ Customer may obtain additional Subscription Licenses under this Agreement by submitting a request through GitHub’s website or via its sales team. A new Order Form will then be generated and if Customer purchases the additional Subscription Licenses, Customer must pay the then-currently applicable Fees for them, prorated for the balance of the applicable Subscription Term. Upon renewal of Customer’s Subscription Licenses for another Subscription Term, GitHub will invoice all Subscription Licenses at once on an annual basis unless otherwise specified in an Order Form.

**8.3** _Add-On Software._ Add-On Software is licensed on a per User basis. For the avoidance of doubt, and unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, the number of Subscription Licenses Customer has at any given time for Add-On Software must equal the number of Subscription Licenses Customer has for the Products under this Agreement. For example, if Customer wishes to purchase a subscription to Advanced Security and already holds Subscription Licenses for 100 Users for the Products, it must purchase Subscription Licenses for 100 Users for Advanced Security.

**9. Delivery.** GitHub will make the License Key available for Customer to download on a secure, password-protected website. All deliveries under this Section 9 will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer is responsible for installation of any Software and acknowledge that GitHub has no further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the License Key. As Updates become available, GitHub will make those available for download on the same website. Customer must Update the Software on a commercially reasonable basis but no less than one (1) time per year. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Customer’s usernames and passwords.

**10. Verification.** At GitHub's request, Customer will promptly provide GitHub with a Software-generated report verifying that Customer is using the Software in accordance with this Agreement. GitHub will invoice Customer for any additional use, effective from the date its use first exceeded the terms of the Agreement.

**11. Support.**

**11.1**  _Standard Support._ GitHub will provide standard technical Support for the Software at no additional charge twenty-four (24) hours per day, five (5) days per week, excluding weekends and national U.S. holidays.

GitHub may provide premium Support (subject to the [Premium Support for Enterprise Server terms](/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-premium-support)) or dedicated technical Support for the Software at the Support level, Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an Order Form or SOW.

**11.2**  _Enhanced Support Offerings._ GitHub may provide enhanced Support offerings for the Software (including the Premium, Premium Plus, and Engineering Direct Support offerings) in accordance with the [Support terms](/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-premium-support), and at the Support level, Fees, and Subscription Term specified in an Order Form or SOW.

**11.3**  _Exclusions._ GitHub will use reasonable efforts to correct any material, reproducible errors in the Software of which Customer notifies GitHub. However, GitHub will not be responsible for providing Support where (i) someone (other than GitHub) modifies the Software; (ii) Customer changes its operating system or environment in a way that adversely affects the Software or its performance; (iii) Customer uses the Software in a manner other than as authorized under this Agreement or the Documentation; or (iv) there is negligence or misuse by Customer of the Software.

**11.4** _Updates; Releases._ GitHub will only Support a given Release of the Software for one (1) year from the original  Release date, or six (6) months from the last Update of the Release, whichever is longer. If Customer requires Support for earlier Releases of the Software, then Customer must pay for that Support in accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed upon Order Form or SOW.

**12. Professional Services.** Upon Customer’s request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide an SOW detailing such Professional Services. GitHub will perform the Professional Services described in each SOW. GitHub will control the manner and means by which the Professional Services are performed and reserves the right to determine  personnel assigned. GitHub may use third parties to perform the Professional Services, provided that GitHub remains responsible for their acts and omissions. Customer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub retains all right, title and interest in and to anything used or developed in connection with performing the Professional Services, including software, tools, specifications, ideas, concepts, inventions, processes, techniques, and know-how. To the extent GitHub delivers anything to Customer while performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with Customer’s use of the Software.

**13. Limited Warranties.**

**13.1** _Limited Software Warranties_. GitHub warrants that: (i) the unmodified Software, at the time it is made available to Customer for download, will not contain or transmit any malware, viruses, or worms (otherwise known as computer code or other technology specifically designed to disrupt, disable, or harm Customer’s software, hardware, computer system, or network) and (ii) for ninety (90) days from the date it is made available for initial download, the unmodified Software will substantially conform to its Documentation.

## GitHub Privacy Statement

## Who is responsible for the processing of your information?
The data controller of your personal data is GitHub, Inc. For individuals outside North America, the data controller is GitHub B.V. 
 
This privacy statement does not apply to personal data we process as a service provider or data processor on behalf of our enterprise customers. Our data processing activities as service processor or data processor is governed by our [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). If you are a consumer end-user of one of those organizations, you should read that organization’s privacy statement and direct any privacy inquiries to that organization. 

## GitHub acting on your behalf

In some cases, GitHub is acting only on your behalf for the personal data we collect and process in connection with our Service (for example, for the personal data added to a repository by the contributors to such repository). In such cases, GitHub will only process the data in order to provide the Service requested by you. Please note that subject to our [Private Information Removal  Policy](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy) contributors’ requests to remove personal data generally require notice to and action from the repository owner.

## What information GitHub collects

The personal data we collect depends on how you interact with us, the services you use, and the choices you make. We collect information about you from different sources and in various ways when you use our Service, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, third-party data sources, and data we infer or generate from other data.


### Information users provide directly to GitHub

- Send you information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, support and administrative messages.

We combine data we collect from different sources for these purposes and to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience.

## How we share the information we collect

We share personal data as described below, including with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your personal data described above with the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:

### Public information
You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, [you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile](https://github.com/settings/emails). You can also [update your local Git configuration to use your private email address](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). Please see more about email addresses in commit messages [here](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). 

Please note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.

### Third-party applications
We share your personal data with third parties when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share your personal data. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.
 
You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products" to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/rest/reference/users) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.

### Organizations with which you engage
You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your personal data. If you collaborate on or become a member of an organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data. When you accept an invitation to an organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see [About Organization Membership](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership)). Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account. 

### Service providers
We share your personal data with service providers who process the information  on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, security, and other similar services. While GitHub processes all personal data in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Such processing by service providers will be in compliance with applicable law including any relevant transfer mechanism. 
 
 ### Affiliates
 We enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems, when affiliates provide services on our behalf, or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service. 

### For security purposes
We will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:
- protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; 
- operate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or 
- protect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.


### For legal disclosure
GitHub may disclose personal data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](/github/site-policy/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data).

### Change in control or sale
We may share your personal data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.
 
Please note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.
 
Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

### No selling of personal data
We *do not* sell your personal data for monetary or other consideration as defined under California and Nevada state laws.
You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it [here](#githubs-notice-to-california-residents).

## Your choices regarding our processing of your personal data
We provide choices about the personal data we collect about you. The choices you make will not apply to any personal data associated with an Organization under your Account. 
 
Access, correction, and deletion. If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us). You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, by changing your cookie preferences, or by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).
 
We retain and use your information as described in this Privacy Statement, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of your request. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users' repositories and comments in others' issues, will remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your personal data, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a ghost user. That said, the email address you have provided via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history — the Git software is designed to maintain a record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.
 
If GitHub processes personal data other than your profile information, such as information about you GitHub receives from [third parties](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your personal data by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).  
 
You can adjust the settings on your Account regarding the display of your personal data in private or public repositories or personal data processed in connection with Community Features (such as GitHub Feed, GitHub Sponsors, and GitHub Explore) through [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
 
Additionally, if you are unable to access certain personal data we have via the means described above, you can request access by contacting us as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.

### Data portability

As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can [clone your repositories to your desktop](/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), for example, or you can use our [Data Portability tools](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-24-user-migration-api/) to download information we have about you.

### Communication preferences
We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have control over how your email address is used and shared on and through our Service. You may manage your communication preferences in your [profile](https://github.com/settings/emails).
 
By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user's email address, such as commit messages. See more details regarding [setting your commit email address](https://github.com/settings/emails). 
 
Depending on your [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), GitHub may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. 
 
Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

### European Data Protection Rights
 
If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:
 
You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data;
If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the personal data in a usable and portable format;
If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing; 
You can to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances; and
For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding the use of your data after your death.
 
To make such requests, please use the contact information at the bottom of this statement.  When we are processing data on behalf of another party (i.e., where GitHub is acting as a data processor) you should direct your request to that party. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
 
We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies. 

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to  (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data as described [here](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls).

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. 

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com. 

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Required Cookies | GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. | 
| Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising. |
| Social Media | GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s  websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub. | 
| Advertising | In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. | 

#### What are your cookie choices and controls?

  You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

  1. **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**
   
     Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

     Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
  2. **Generally for all websites**

    You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
     - If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
     - Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
     - If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
     - If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
     - Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
       - United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
       - Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
       - Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

    These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.



## Retention of personal data
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your personal data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes. 

## How GitHub secures your information
GitHub takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account has private repositories, you control the access to that Content. GitHub personnel does not access private repository content except for
- security purposes, 
- automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
- to assist the repository owner with a support matter
- to maintain the integrity of the Service
- to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, 
- or with your consent.

GitHub will provide notice regarding private repository access where not prohibited by law or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

### Cross-border data transfers
GitHub processes personal data both inside and outside of the United States and relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses to lawfully transfer data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses using the contact details provided in the section entitled “Contacting GitHub” below.

("GitHub", "we") provides this statement to those residents ("you") in accordance with requirements under the CCPA to make certain disclosures about the collection and processing of their personal information.

### We do not sell your personal information
Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents' personal information to others: 1) must give notice to California residents before selling their personal information to others; and 2) must provide the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.
GitHub does not sell personal information, including personal information of anyone under 16 years old. 

### Your rights under the CCPA
The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to their personal information. To submit a request based on these rights, please contact us via our [contact form](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=docs-policy).



When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the request is the resident to whom the personal information subject to the request pertains. California residents may exercise their rights themselves or may use an authorized agent, designated in writing or through a power of attorney, to make requests on their behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require that you provide us additional information demonstrating that the agent is acting on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
With respect to your personal information, California residents may exercise the rights described below.
#### Right to Know. 
You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information.  Note that we have provided much of this information in this privacy statement. You can use GitHub’s User Migration tool to access and download your data. Learn more [here](/get-started/privacy-on-github/requesting-an-archive-of-your-personal-accounts-data). You may also make such a “request to know” by contacting us [here](https://support.github.com/contact/privacy).
#### Right to Request Deletion. 
You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to delete, you can contact us [here](https://support.github.com/contact/privacy) or use the account settings [here](https://github.com/settings/admin).

#### Right to Opt-Out. 
You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information. Note that we do not “sell” personal information as defined by the CCPA and have not done so in the past 12 months. 

#### Right to Non-Discrimination. 
You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising your CCPA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to submit the request from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide information necessary to verify your account. [Please note that you may use two-factor authentication with your GitHub account](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication).  
Finally, you have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before collection of personal information.
 
Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.
California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing **(privacy [at] github [dot] com)**. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.

California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online sites, services, or applications have a right under California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 to remove, or request and obtain removal of, content or information they have publicly posted. To remove content or information you have publicly posted, [please submit a Private Information Removal request](https://support.github.com/contact/private-information). Alternatively, to request that we remove such content or information, please send a detailed description of the specific content or information you wish to have removed to [GitHub support](https://support.github.com/contact). Please be aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require removal in certain circumstances.

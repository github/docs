## GitHub Privacy Statement

## Who is responsible for the processing of your information?

The data controller of your personal data is GitHub, Inc. For individuals outside North America, the data controller is GitHub B.V.

This privacy statement does not apply to personal data we process as a service provider or data processor on behalf of our enterprise customers. Our data processing activities as service provider or data processor is governed by our [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). If you are an end-user of one of those organizations, such as an employee or student, you should read that organization’s privacy statement and direct any privacy inquiries to that organization.

## GitHub acting on your behalf

In some cases, GitHub is acting only on your behalf for the personal data we collect and process in connection with our Service (for example, for the personal data added to a repository by the contributors to such repository). In such cases, GitHub will only process the data in order to provide, protect, and improve Service. Please note that subject to our [Private Information Removal Policy](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy) contributors’ requests to remove personal data generally require notice to and action from the repository owner.

## What information GitHub collects

The personal data we collect depends on how you interact with us, the services you use, and the choices you make. We collect information about you from different sources and in various ways when you use our Service, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, third-party data sources, and data we infer or generate from other data.

### Information users provide directly to GitHub

We collect personal data you provide to us. For example:

#### Registration information

We collect information such as your name and contact data, including username and email address, and credentials such as your password, during account creation.

#### Demographic information

In some cases, we request that you provide age, gender, and similar demographic details.

#### Payment and billing information

If you make a purchase or other financial transaction, we collect credit card numbers, financial account information, and other payment details.

#### Content and files

We collect any code, text, photographs, documents, or other files, including videos or recordings, you upload to our Service; and if you send us email messages or other communications, we collect and retain those communications. For example, you may choose to give us more information for your Account profile, such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third-party website. Please note that your profile information may be visible to other Users of our Service.

#### Feedback and ratings

We collect any feedback or ratings you provide, including through written communications and via surveys.

### Information GitHub automatically collects

When you visit or use our Service, we collect some information automatically. For example:

#### Transaction information, Subscription and licensing data

If you have a paid Account or subscription with us, or make a purchase or sale using our Service, we automatically collect certain information about your transactions on the Service, such as your full name, address, region, state, country, zip code, the date, time, and amount charged.

#### Usage information and Interactions

If you're accessing or using our Service, we may automatically collect information about how you use and how your device interacts with the Service, such as the pages you view, the referring site, your IP address and information about your device, session information, the date and time of each request, device type and ID, operation system and application version, information contained in or relating to your contributions to individual repositories, and telemetry data (i.e., information about how a specific feature or service is performing) regarding your use of other features and functionality of the Service. As further described below, we automatically collect usage information and interaction data using cookies (which may use  a cookie ID), depending on your settings or preferences, in connection with our Service.

#### Geolocation information

In connection with certain features and depending on the functionality of the Service, we collect geolocation information such as through IP addresses or the location information you choose to provide in your Account profile.

### Information we create or generate

We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (“inferences”). For example, we infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP address.

### Information we collect from third parties

Other companies with whom you choose to engage. GitHub may collect personal data about you from third parties. For example, this may happen if you sign up for training or to receive information about GitHub from one of our vendors, partners, or affiliates. GitHub does not purchase personal data from third-party data brokers.

Service Providers. We may also receive information from processors or service providers who process the data on our behalf, such as our payment processor who process payment and billing information in connection with our Service.

Content you post on our Service. Information you store in, or contribute to, a public repository, provide for use in connection with a Community Feature or make otherwise publicly available through the Service will be collected by GitHub as described in this Privacy Statement. Such information may also be available to the GitHub user community as well as the general public. For more information about repositories and community features, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile)."

Co-branding/marketing partners. We may receive information from partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.

Publicly available sources. We may also obtain information from publicly available sources as GitHub repositories.

When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional.

## How GitHub uses your information

We may use your information to provide, administer, analyze, manage, and operate our Service. For example, we use your information for the following purposes:
- Provide our products and deliver our services including troubleshooting, improving, and personalizing the features on the Service.
- Business operations such as billing, accounting, improving our internal operations, securing our systems, detecting fraudulent or illegal activity, and meeting our legal obligations.
- Improve and develop our products and services including to develop new services or features, and conduct research.
- Personalization of our Service by understanding you and your preferences to enhance your experience and enjoyment using our Service.
- Provide customer support and respond to your questions.
- Deliver promotional communications with you about new services, features, offers, promotions, and other information about our Service.
- Personalize and measure the effectiveness of enterprise business ads, including those you see off of the Services, promotional communications or marketing you receive related to the Enterprise Marketing Pages.
- Send you information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, support and administrative messages.

We combine data we collect from different sources for these purposes and to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience.

## How we share the information we collect

We share personal data as described below, including with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your personal data described above with the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:

### Public information

You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, [you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile](https://github.com/settings/emails). You can also [update your local Git configuration to use your private email address](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

Please note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.

### Third-party applications

We share your personal data with third party applications when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products," to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Products and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/rest/users) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.

### Organizations with which you engage

You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your personal data with Organizations, as defined in [GitHub’s Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), who also use the Services. If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data, for example by having the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.

When you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see [About Organization Membership](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/about-organization-membership)). Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account.

### Service providers

We share your personal data with service providers who process the information on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, security, online advertising, and other similar services. Our service providers may process data in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where they operate facilities.

Such processing by service providers and any related cross border data transfers will be in compliance with applicable law.

### Affiliates

We enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems, when affiliates provide services on our behalf, or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service.

GitHub has the responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### For security purposes

We will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:
- protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
- operate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or
- protect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.

### For legal disclosure

GitHub may disclose personal data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data).

### Change in control or sale

We may share your personal data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.

Please note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.

Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

## Your choices regarding our processing of your personal data

We provide choices about the personal data we collect about you. The choices you make will not apply to any personal data associated with an Organization under your Account.

Access, correction, and deletion. If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us). You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, by changing your cookie preferences, or by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).

We retain and use your information as described in this Privacy Statement, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of your request. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users' repositories and comments in others' issues, will remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your personal data, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a ghost user. That said, the email address you have provided via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history — the Git software is designed to maintain a record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.

If GitHub processes personal data other than your profile information, such as [information about you GitHub receives from third parties](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your personal data by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).

You can adjust the settings on your Account regarding the display of your personal data in private or public repositories or personal data processed in connection with Community Features (such as GitHub Feed, GitHub Sponsors, and GitHub Explore) through [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).

Additionally, if you are unable to access certain personal data we have via the means described above, you can request access by contacting us as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.

### Data portability

As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can [clone your repositories to your desktop](/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), for example, or you can use our [Data Portability tools](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-24-user-migration-api/) to download information we have about you.

### Communication preferences

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have control over how your email address is used and shared with other Users on and through our Service. You may manage your communication preferences in [your profile's email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user's email address, such as commit messages. See more details regarding [setting your commit email address](https://github.com/settings/emails).

Depending on your email settings, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you.

Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of GitHub. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](https://github.com/privacy/cookies) that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

For Enterprise Marketing Pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to  (i) gather information about enterprise users’ interests and online activities to personalize their experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations, and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts. If you disable the non-essential cookies on the Enterprise Marketing Pages, the ads, content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls)."

#### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The GitHub Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners. For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes, including targeted advertising. GitHub will place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example, on resources.github.com.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.

The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:

| Purpose | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Required Cookies | GitHub uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. |
| Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising. |
| Social Media | GitHub and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on GitHub’s  websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by GitHub. |
| Advertising | In addition, GitHub and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |

#### What are your cookie choices and controls?

  You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

  1. **Specifically on GitHub Enterprise Marketing Pages**

     Any GitHub page that serves non-essential cookies will have a link in the page’s footer to cookie settings. You can express your preferences at any time by clicking on that linking and updating your settings.

     Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject all non-essential cookies.
  1. **Generally for all websites**
  You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:
  - If your browser sends a [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (DNT) signal, GitHub will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.
  - Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.
  - If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger), non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
  - If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin), non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
  - You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If GitHub detects the GPC signal from your device, GitHub will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit [Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
  - Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:
  - United States: [NAI](http://optout.networkadvertising.org) and [DAA](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
  - Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
  - Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

## Retention of personal data

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your personal data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes.

## How GitHub secures your information

GitHub takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account has private repositories, you control the access to that Content. GitHub personnel does not access private repository content except for
- security purposes,
- automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
- to assist the repository owner with a support matter
- to maintain the integrity of the Service
- to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law,
- or with your consent.

GitHub will provide notice regarding private repository access where not prohibited by law or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

### Cross-border data transfers

## Data Privacy Framework (DPF)

GitHub complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. GitHub has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.

GitHub may store and process your personal data in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where GitHub or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.

We transfer personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints. When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on [the European Commission website](https://commission.europa.eu/index). You may view a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses on the GitHub Customer Agreements website under the [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement).

**Disclosures of personal data for business or commercial purposes**.

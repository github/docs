## GitHub Privacy Statement

## Who is responsible for the processing of your information?
The data controller of your personal data is GitHub, Inc. For individuals outside North America, the data controller is GitHub B.V. 
 
This privacy statement does not apply to personal data we process as a service provider or data processor on behalf of our enterprise customers. Our data processing activities as service processor or data processor is governed by our [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). If you are a consumer end-user of one of those organizations, you should read that organization’s privacy statement and direct any privacy inquiries to that organization. 

## GitHub acting on your behalf

In some cases, GitHub is acting only on your behalf for the personal data we collect and process in connection with our Service (for example, for the personal data added to a repository by the contributors to such repository). In such cases, GitHub will only process the data in order to provide the Service requested by you. Please note that subject to our [Private Information Removal  Policy](/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-private-information-removal-policy) contributors’ requests to remove personal data generally require notice to and action from the repository owner.

## What information GitHub collects

The personal data we collect depends on how you interact with us, the services you use, and the choices you make. We collect information about you from different sources and in various ways when you use our Service, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, third-party data sources, and data we infer or generate from other data.


### Information users provide directly to GitHub
We collect personal data you provide to us. For example:

#### Registration information
We collect information such as your username, email address, and password during account creation.

#### Demographic information
In some cases, we request that you provide age, gender, and similar demographic details.

#### Payment and billing information
If you make a purchase or other financial transaction, we collect credit card numbers, financial account information, and other payment details.

#### Content and files
We collect any photographs, documents, or other files you upload to our Service; and if you send us email messages or other communications, we collect and retain those communications. For example, you may choose to give us more information for your Account profile, such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third-party website. Please note that your profile information may be visible to other Users of our Service.

### Information GitHub automatically collects.
When you visit or use our Service, we collect some information automatically. For example:

#### Transaction information
If you have a paid Account with us, or make a purchase or sale using our Service, we automatically collect certain information about your transactions on the Service, such as your full name, address, region, state, country, zip code, the date, time, and amount charged. 

#### Usage information
If you're accessing or using our Service, we may automatically collect information about how you use the Service, such as the pages you view, the referring site, your IP address and information about your device, session information, the date and time of each request, information contained in or relating to your contributions to individual repositories, and telemetry data (i.e., information about how a specific feature or service is performing) regarding your use of other features and functionality of the Service.

#### Cookies
As further described below, we automatically collect information from cookies (such as cookie ID and settings) in connection with our Service.

#### Device information
We may collect information about your device, such as its IP address, browser or client application information, language preference, operating system and application version, device type and ID, and device model and manufacturer. 

#### Geolocation information
In connection with certain features and depending on the functionality of the Service, we collect geolocation information such as through IP addresses or the location information you choose to provide in your Account profile.

### Information we create or generate
We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (“inferences”). For example, we infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP address.

### Information we collect from third parties

Other companies with whom you choose to engage. GitHub may collect personal data about you from third parties. For example, this may happen if you sign up for training or to receive information about GitHub from one of our vendors, partners, or affiliates. GitHub does not purchase personal data from third-party data brokers. 
 
Service Providers. We may also receive information from processors or service providers who process the data on our behalf, such as our payment processor who process payment and billing information in connection with our Service.
 
Content you post on our Service. Information you store in, or contribute to, a public repository, provide for use in connection with a Community Feature or make otherwise publicly available through the Service will be collected by GitHub as described in this Privacy Statement. Such information may also be available to the GitHub user community as well as the general public. For more information, please review details regarding public repositories and community features [here](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/about-your-profile).
 
Co-branding/marketing partners. We may receive information from partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities. 
 
Publicly available sources. We may also obtain information from publicly available sources as GitHub repositories. 
 
When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional.

## How GitHub uses your information
We may use your information to provide, administer, analyze, manage, and operate our Service. For example, we use your information for the following purposes:
- Provide our products and deliver our services including troubleshooting, improving, and personalizing the features on the Service.
- Business operations such as billing, accounting, improving our internal operations, securing our systems, detecting fraudulent or illegal activity, and meeting our legal obligations.
- Improve and develop our products and services including to develop new services or features, and conduct research.
- Personalization of our Service by understanding you and your preferences to enhance your experience and enjoyment using our Service.
- Provide customer support and respond to your questions.
- Deliver promotional communications with you about new services, features, offers, promotions, and other information about our Service.
- Send you information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, support and administrative messages.

We combine data we collect from different sources for these purposes and to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience.

## How we share the information we collect

We share personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your personal data described above with the types of third parties  described below for the following business purposes:

### Public information
You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, [you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile](https://github.com/settings/emails). You can also [update your local Git configuration to use your private email address](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). Please see more about email addresses in commit messages [here](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). 

Please note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our [Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.

### Third-party applications
We share your personal data with third parties when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share your personal data. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.
 
You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products" to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/rest/reference/users) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.

### Organizations with which you engage
You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your personal data. If you collaborate on or become a member of an organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data. When you accept an invitation to an organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see [About Organization Membership](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership)). Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account. 

### Service providers
We share your personal data with service providers who process the information  on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While GitHub processes all personal data in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Such processing by service providers will be in compliance with applicable law including any relevant transfer mechanism. 
 
 ### Affiliates
 We enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service. 

### For security purposes
We will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:
- protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; 
- operate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or 
- protect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.


### For legal disclosure
GitHub may disclose personal data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](/github/site-policy/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data).

### Change in control or sale
We may share your personal data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.
 
Please note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.
 
Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

### No selling of personal data
We *do not* sell your personal data for monetary or other consideration as defined under California and Nevada state laws.
You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it [here](#githubs-notice-to-california-residents).

## Your choices regarding our processing of your personal data
We provide choices about the personal data we collect about you. The choices you make will not apply to any personal data associated with an Organization under your Account. 
 
Access, correction, and deletion. If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us). You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, or by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).
 
We retain and use your information as described in this Privacy Statement, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of your request. After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users' repositories and comments in others' issues, will remain. However, we will delete or de-identify your personal data, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a ghost user. That said, the email address you have provided via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. If you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history — the Git software is designed to maintain a record — but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.
 
If GitHub processes personal data other than your profile information, such as information about you GitHub receives from [third parties](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your personal data by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).  
 
You can adjust the settings on your Account regarding the display of your personal data in private or public repositories or personal data processed in connection with Community Features (such as GitHub Feed, GitHub Sponsors, and GitHub Explore) through [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
 
Additionally, if you are unable to access certain personal data we have via the means described above, you can request access by contacting us as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.

### Data portability

As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you. You can [clone your repositories to your desktop](/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop), for example, or you can use our [Data Portability tools](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-24-user-migration-api/) to download information we have about you.

### Communication preferences
We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have control over how your email address is used and shared on and through our Service. You may manage your communication preferences in your [profile](https://github.com/settings/emails).
 
By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a user's email address, such as commit messages. See more details regarding [setting your commit email address](https://github.com/settings/emails). 
 
Depending on your [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), GitHub may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. 
 
Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

### European Data Protection Rights
 
If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:
 
You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data;
If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the personal data in a usable and portable format;
If the processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing; 
You can to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal data under certain circumstances; and
For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding the use of your data after your death.
 
To make such requests, please use the contact information at the bottom of this statement.  When we are processing data on behalf of another party (i.e., where GitHub is acting as a data processor) you should direct your request to that party. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.
 
We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our  Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, compile statistical reports, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We use our own cookies and do not use any third-party service providers in this context. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use our Service. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies#cookies-on-github) on our [GitHub Subprocessors and Cookies](/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies) page that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

### DNT

"[Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)" (DNT) is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. GitHub responds to browser DNT signals and follows the [W3C standard for responding to DNT signals](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/). If you would like to set your browser to signal that you would not like to be tracked, please check your browser's documentation for how to enable that signal. There are also good applications that block online tracking, such as [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/).

## Retention of personal data
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your personal data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes. 

## How GitHub secures your information
GitHub takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your personal data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account has private repositories, you control the access to that Content. GitHub personnel does not access private repository content except for
- security purposes, 
- automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
- to assist the repository owner with a support matter
- to maintain the integrity of the Service
- to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, 
- or with your consent.

Github will provide notice regarding private repository access where not prohibited by law or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

### Cross-border data transfers
GitHub processes personal data both inside and outside of the United States and relies on legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses to lawfully transfer data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States. You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses using the contact details provided in the section entitled “Contacting GitHub” below. 

### Resolving complaints

You may contact us by filling out the [Privacy contact form](https://support.github.com/contact/privacy). You may also email us directly at **(privacy [at] github [dot] com)** with the subject line "Privacy Concerns." We will respond promptly — within 45 days at the latest.

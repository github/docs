## Prepare materials

Before you apply for a GitHub for Nonprofits discount, you will want to make sure:

* You are the administrator or owner of the GitHub organization you are applying on behalf of.
* You have all necessary nonprofit documentation such as tax information and/or legal documents certifying your nonprofit status.
* You have reviewed all nonprofit eligibility information: GitHub for Nonprofit accounts are designed for 501(c)(3) or equivalent nonprofit organizations that are non-governmental, non-academic, non-commercial, non-political in nature, and have no religious affiliation.

## Applying for nonprofit benefits

1. To claim your discount, visit our [GitHub for Nonprofits self-serve portal](https://nonprofits.github.com/).

1. Log into GitHub.
1. To authorize GitHub for Nonprofits to access your organization account on GitHub, click **Grant**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you see a **Request** button instead of a **Grant** button, you are a member of the organization, not an owner. An owner must approve your request for GitHub for Nonprofit. You must be an organization owner to claim the GitHub for Nonprofit. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#oauth-apps-and-organizations).

1. If your nonprofit is already in our database as a validated organization, you will be prompted to select your GitHub for Nonprofits discount. If your organization is not automatically validated, you will be asked to complete the validation application.

    Application questions include:

    * Country of nonprofit registration
    * Nonprofit name or registration ID
    * Confirmation that your nonprofit is nongovernmental, nonacademic, noncommercial, nonpolitical, and has no religious affiliation
    * Website (optional, but recommended)

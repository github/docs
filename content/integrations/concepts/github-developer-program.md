## Build a personal or open-source tool

Create tools that seamlessly integrate with the platform where you push code every day.

## Take on the enterprise

## Have an integration that works with GitHub?

Great! Here’s how you can share it with others:

- Use the [Octocat or GitHub logo](https://github.com/logos) to indicate that your product works with GitHub.
- Publish a blog post or video on your website explaining how your integration works.

Examples of integrations include GitHub Apps, OAuth apps, GitHub Actions, or tools that use the GitHub REST or GraphQL APIs.

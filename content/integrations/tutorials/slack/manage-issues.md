## Managing issues in Slack

With the {% data variables.product.github %} integration in Slack, you can comment on, edit, and close issues directly from Slack. You must be connected to the {% data variables.product.github %} app in Slack and have the necessary permissions to manage issues in the relevant repository.

1. In Slack, under the preview of the issue you want to manage, select the appropriate action:

   * To comment on the issue, click **Comment**. In the dialog, type your comment and click **Post**.
   * To edit the issue title or description, click **Edit**. In the dialog, update the title or description as needed and click **Save**.
   * To close the issue, click **Close issue**. In the dialog, confirm that you want to close the issue by clicking **Close issue** again.

   >[!NOTE] If you do not see these options, you may not have the necessary permissions to manage issues in the repository.

## About categories for discussions

{% data reusables.discussions.about-discussions %} {% data reusables.discussions.about-categories-and-formats %}

{% data reusables.discussions.about-announcement-format %}

Each category must have a unique name and emoji pairing, and can be accompanied by a detailed description stating its purpose. Categories help maintainers organize how conversations are filed and are customizable to help distinguish categories that are Q&A or more open-ended conversations. {% data reusables.discussions.repository-category-limit %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions#about-categories-and-formats-for-discussions)."

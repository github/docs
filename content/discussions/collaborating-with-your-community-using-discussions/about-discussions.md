## About {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} allows your project's community to engage in conversations about the project's direction and future in an open-ended format. Maintainers, contributors, and visitors can gather in a central location, without third-party tools.

* Share announcements and information
* Plan and make decisions with community input
* Encourage and answer questions, and mark them answered as you respond to them
* Gauge community opinion using polls

You can use **repository** discussions to discuss topics that are specific to one repository and **organization** discussions for broader conversations that span multiple repositories.

Anyone with access to a repository or organization can create and participate in discussions there. However, an administrator must enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for the repository or organization first.

## Managing discussions

{% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} includes tools for managing discussions, and for using discussions to manage the repository or organization.

* Pin discussions to give topics more visibility
* Mark comments as answers in question-and-answer categories to help users find information more quickly
* Lock discussions that have reached a conclusion or become too heated
* Convert open-ended issues into discussions
* Close discussions that are no longer useful

Discussions are opened in user-defined categories, and can be further organized with repository labels. For more information about discussion management, see [AUTOTITLE](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions).

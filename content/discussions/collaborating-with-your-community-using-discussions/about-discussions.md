## About {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}

With {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, the community for your project can create and participate in conversations within the project's repository or organization. Discussions empower a project's maintainers, contributors, and visitors to gather and accomplish the following goals in a central location, without third-party tools.

* Share announcements and information, gather feedback, plan, and make decisions
* Ask questions, discuss and answer the questions, and mark the discussions as answered
* Create polls to gauge community opinion
* Upvote discussions and comments to give higher visibility to ideas you find valuable
* Foster an inviting atmosphere for visitors and contributors to discuss goals, development, administration, and workflows

You might use repository discussions to discuss topics that are specific to the repository. If your project spans multiple repositories, you might use organization discussions to discuss topics that aren't specific to a single repository in your organization.

If a repository administrator or project maintainer enables {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a repository, anyone who has access to the repository can create and participate in discussions for the repository. If an organization owner enables {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for an organization, anyone who can view the source repository can create an organization discussion.

Repository administrators and project maintainers can manage discussions and discussion categories in a repository, and pin discussions to increase the visibility of the discussion. Moderators and collaborators can mark comments as answers, lock discussions, and convert issues to discussions. Similarly, for organization discussions, the role of a user in the source repository determines how a user can interact with organization discussions.

## Understanding Webhook Events and Payloads

Webhooks enable you to build or set up integrations that subscribe to specific events on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. When one of those events is triggered, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook's configured URL. To minimize the load on your server, it's crucial to subscribe only to the events your integration needs to handle. You can learn more about setting up webhooks in "[Creating Webhooks](/webhooks/creating-webhooks)."

On this page, you'll find a detailed description of the properties included in the webhook payload for each event. If an event has multiple associated actions (for example, an issue can be `opened`, `closed`, or `edited`), you'll see the specific properties relevant to each action.

Keep in mind that the availability of certain webhook events depends on the type of webhook you're creating. For instance, an organization webhook can subscribe to `team` events, while a repository webhook cannot. The description for each event clearly indicates its availability. For more details, refer to "[Types of Webhooks](/webhooks/types-of-webhooks)."

### Payload Size Considerations

### Examining Delivery Headers

When {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sends an HTTP POST request to your webhook's URL, it includes several custom headers that provide valuable context about the delivery:

* `X-GitHub-Hook-ID`: This is a unique identifier assigned to your specific webhook. You can use this to track and manage your webhooks.
* `X-GitHub-Event`: This header specifies the exact name of the event that triggered the webhook delivery. For example, it might be `issues`, `pull_request`, or `push`.
* `X-GitHub-Delivery`: A universally unique identifier (GUID) for each specific event delivery. This is helpful for debugging and tracking individual webhook calls.
* `User-Agent`: This header always starts with `GitHub-Hookshot/`, indicating that the request originates from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}â€™s webhook system.
* `X-GitHub-Hook-Installation-Target-Type`: This indicates the type of resource where the webhook was created. Possible values include `repository`, `organization`, or `marketplace_account`.
* `X-GitHub-Hook-Installation-Target-ID`: This is the unique numerical identifier of the resource where the webhook was created.

{% ifversion ghes %}

* `X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version`: If you're using {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, this header provides the specific version of your instance that sent the webhook payload.
* `X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host`: For {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} users, this header contains the hostname of your instance.

{% endif %}

#### Securing Your Webhooks with Signatures

{% data reusables.webhooks.security-headers %}

* `X-Hub-Signature`: This header is present if you've configured a `secret` for your webhook. It contains the HMAC-SHA1 hash of the request body, using your `secret` as the key. While provided for backward compatibility, we recommend using the more secure `X-Hub-Signature-256`.
* `X-Hub-Signature-256`: This header is also sent when a `secret` is configured. It contains the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request body, offering a stronger level of security. For detailed information on securing your webhooks, see "[Securing your webhooks](/webhooks/using-webhooks/securing-your-webhooks)."

To get a clearer picture of these headers in action, take a look at the "[Example webhook delivery](#example-webhook-delivery)" section below.

### Example Webhook Delivery

You have the flexibility to choose whether webhook payloads are delivered in JSON format (`application/json`) or as URL-encoded data (`x-www-form-urlencoded`). The following example illustrates a webhook POST request using the more common JSON format.

```shell
> POST /payload HTTP/1.1
> X-GitHub-Delivery: 72d3162e-cc78-11e3-81ab-4c9367dc0958{% ifversion ghes %}
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version: 2.15.0
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host: example.com{% endif %}
> X-Hub-Signature: sha1=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6
> X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=d57c68ca6f92289e6987922ff26938930f6e66a2d161ef06abdf1859230aa23c

```
### Quick Webhook Testing

To easily inspect webhook payloads from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} without a dedicated application, consider these tools:

* **Beeceptor:** Create instant HTTP endpoints to inspect headers and payloads. Visit [https://beeceptor.com/](https://beeceptor.com/).
* **HTTPBin:** Use the `/post` endpoint to see the details of your webhook requests at [https://httpbin.org/](https://httpbin.org/).

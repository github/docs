## About webhook delivery failures

A webhook delivery can fail for multiple reasons. For example, if your server is down or takes longer than {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}10{% else %}30{% endif %} seconds to respond, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will record the delivery as a failure.

{% data variables.product.company_short %} does not automatically redeliver failed deliveries.

## Handling delivery failures

You can manually redeliver failed deliveries. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/testing-and-troubleshooting-webhooks/redelivering-webhooks)."

You can also write a script that checks for failed deliveries and attempts to redeliver any that failed. Your script should run on a schedule and do the following:

1. Use the {% data variables.product.company_short %} REST API to fetch data about any webhook deliveries that were attempted since the last time that your script ran. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/webhooks/repo-deliveries#list-deliveries-for-a-repository-webhook)," "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/webhooks#list-deliveries-for-an-organization-webhook)," and "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/webhooks#list-deliveries-for-an-app-webhook)."

   {% ifversion fpt %}There are no API endpoints to get data about {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhooks or {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} webhooks.{% endif %}{% ifversion ghec %}There are no API endpoints to get data about {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhooks, {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} webhooks, or global webhooks.{% endif %}{% ifversion ghes %}There are no API endpoints to get data about global webhook deliveries.{% endif %}

1. Look at the fetched data to see if any deliveries failed. The data for a failed delivery will have a `status` value that is not `OK`.
1. Use the {% data variables.product.company_short %} REST API to redeliver any deliveries that failed. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/webhooks/repo-deliveries#redeliver-a-delivery-for-a-repository-webhook)," "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/webhooks#redeliver-a-delivery-for-an-organization-webhook)," and "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/apps/webhooks#redeliver-a-delivery-for-an-app-webhook)."

For example scripts, see:

* "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-a-script-to-automatically-redeliver-failed-deliveries-for-a-repository-webhook)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-a-script-to-automatically-redeliver-failed-deliveries-for-an-organization-webhook)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-a-script-to-automatically-redeliver-failed-deliveries-for-a-github-app-webhook)"

If a webhook delivery fails repeatedly, you should investigate the cause. Each failed delivery will give a reason for failure. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/testing-and-troubleshooting-webhooks/troubleshooting-webhooks)."

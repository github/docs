## About the referrer policy for your enterprise

The referrer policy controls the information that {% data variables.product.product_name %} transmits in HTTP headers when someone visits a link from {% data variables.location.product_location %} to an external site.

By default, when a user on {% data variables.location.product_location %} visits a link to another site from a file or comment on your instance, the request includes the hostname for your instance in plain text within the `Referer` header. If the link leads to an external website, the owner of the website could read the hostname for your instance in requests or log files.

You can control the information that {% data variables.product.product_name %} sends when a user visits a link from your instance.

## Enabling the `same-origin` referrer policy

You can enable the `same-origin` referrer policy to instruct modern browsers to exclude the hostname for {% data variables.location.product_location %} from requests to external websites. The setting applies to all links from the web interface on your instance. By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} uses the `origin-when-cross-origin` and `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` referrer policies, which means your instance's hostname will appear in HTTP and HTTPS requests to external websites.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the referrer policy to `same-origin` can affect external sites that expect a hostname in the HTTP headers for a request.

## Overview

This guide will help you to set up both SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning for {% data variables.product.github %} on PingFederate.

Before you start, please note the following:

{%- ifversion ghes %}
* The use of PingFederate as an IdP for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} is in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %}. Please contact your account team to provide feedback.
{%- endif %}
* This guide is based on PingFederate version 12.1. Instructions may vary for other versions.
* This guide provides the minimal steps to configure a working setup. Because your identity directory may be connected to PingFederate differently, you’ll need to pick the correct data attributes for SAML and SCIM based on what is available from your backing data store.

## Prerequisites

{% ifversion ghec %}

If you're configuring SCIM provisioning for a new enterprise, make sure to complete all previous steps in the initial configuration process. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/getting-started-with-enterprise-managed-users).

{% else %}

The general prerequisites for using SCIM on {% data variables.product.product_name %} apply. See the "Prerequisites" section in [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users#prerequisites).

{% endif %}

In addition:

{%- ifversion ghes %}
* To configure SCIM, you must have completed **steps 1 to 4** in [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users).
  * You will need the {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} created for the setup user to authenticate requests from PingFederate.
{%- endif %}
* You must have installed the "GitHub EMU connector" on PingFederate. To download and install the connector, see [Install the provisioner](https://docs.pingidentity.com/integrations/github/github_emu_provisioner/wie1563995015164.html) in the PingIdentity documentation.
* To provision users with SCIM, you must use an LDAP server as the backing data store.
* You may need to configure the firewall in PingFederate to allow outbound connections to {% ifversion ghes %}the `https://HOSTNAME/api/v3/scim/v2` endpoint on your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance.{% else %}the SCIM endpoints on {% data variables.product.github %}:
  * For **{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}**: `https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/ENTERPRISE`
  * For **{% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}**: `https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/scim/v2/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN`{% endif %}
* PingFederate's "provisioner mode" must be set to a value that allows SCIM provisioning. See the "Before you begin" section in PingIdentity's [Configuring outbound provisioning settings](https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingfederate/11.2/administrators_reference_guide/help_protocolsettingstasklet_saasglobalprovisioningsettingsstate.html) guide.
* During this procedure, you will need to upload an X509 certificate to PingFederate. You may want to create and store the certificate before proceeding. You will also need the challenge password for the certificate. See the [Example of creating an X509 certificate](#example-of-creating-an-x509-certificate) section later in this article.
{%- ifversion ghec %}
* During this procedure, you will need to upload a SAML metadata file to PingFederate. If you're setting up an enterprise that uses **{% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_short %} on {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}**, it is easiest to create this file before you start. See [Creating a SAML metadata file for {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}](#creating-a-saml-metadata-file-for-ghecom).
{%- endif %}

## 1. Configure SAML

In this section you will create a SAML connector in PingFederate, set up an LDAP IdP adapter instance, and manage SAML output from your IdP adapter.

1. On the "SP Connections" page, in the row for your new connection, click **Select Action**, then **Export Metadata**.
1. On the "Metadata Signing" tab, in the row for your new connection, select the signing certificate you created above. To download the certificate, click **Next**, then click **Export**.
1. On PingFederate, click **System** in the header, then **Server**, then **Protocol Settings**. Check that the `SAML 2.0 ENTITY ID` is defined. Make a note of this, as you will need it for the “Issuer” field in {% data variables.product.github %}'s SAML settings.
1. Open the metadata file you downloaded, and have it ready for the next steps.

### Configure {% data variables.product.github %}

1. Sign in to {% data variables.product.github %} as {% ifversion ghec %}the setup user for your enterprise{% else %}a user with access to the Management Console{% endif %}.
1. Enable SAML in your enterprise settings. See {% ifversion ghec %}[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/configuring-authentication-for-enterprise-managed-users/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-enterprise-managed-users#configure-saml-sso-for-enterprise-managed-users).{% else %}[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise#configuring-saml-sso).{% endif %}
1. Enter the following values from the SAML metadata file from the previous section.

   * For the "Single sign-on URL," use the `location` value of the `<md: SingleSignOnService>` field. This should be a URL ending `/idp/SSO.saml2`.
   * For the "Issuer," use the `entityId` value of the `<md: EntityDescriptor>` field (a URL).

1. For the "Verification certificate," upload the X509 certificate file that you created earlier.
1. Click **Save settings**.

## 2. Configure SCIM

In this section, you'll configure SCIM settings and attribute mapping on PingFederate.

1. [Configure SCIM settings](#configure-scim-settings)
1. [Map LDAP fields to SCIM](#map-ldap-fields-to-scim)
1. [Finish configuration and test](#finish-configuration-and-test)

Before starting this section, ensure you have followed {% ifversion ghec %}the previous steps in [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/getting-started-with-enterprise-managed-users).{% else %}steps **1 to 4** in [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users).{% endif %}

### Configure SCIM settings

1. Go back to the "SP Connections" page on PingFederate, and select the SP connection you created earlier.
1. Click the "Connection Type" tab.
1. Select **Outbound Provisioning**.
1. Ensure **Browser SSO Profiles** is selected.
1. Click **Next** until you reach the "Outbound Provisioning" tab, then click **Configure Provisioning**.
1. On the "Target" tab, enter the following details.

   * "Base URL": {% ifversion ghes %}`https://HOSTNAME/api/v3/scim/v2`{% else %}`https://api.github.com/scim/v2/enterprises/{enterprise}/` or `https://api.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/scim/v2/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN`{% endif %}
   * "Access Token": The {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} created for the setup user
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Manage Channel" tab, click **Create**, then enter a unique channel name, such as `pfghscim`.
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Source" tab, choose the data store that you created earlier.
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Source Settings" tab, you can keep all default settings. Other settings are likely to work, but have not been confirmed.
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Source Location" tab, configure where in your LDAP server you would like provisioned users to come from. This will vary depending on your setup and needs. After configuring, click **Next**.

### Map LDAP fields to SCIM

On the "Attribute Mapping" tab, you will need to map fields from your LDAP server to SCIM fields. See the following list for {% data variables.product.github %}'s supported SCIM fields and the values expected in each one.

* **Username:** This will be normalized and used as the {% data variables.product.github %} username for the provisioned user. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/iam-configuration-reference/username-considerations-for-external-authentication#about-username-normalization). This must match the normalization of the subject sent with the SAML assertion that you configured with the `SAML_SUBJECT` property in PingFederate.
* **Email:** A field containing the user's email address.
* **Display Name:** A human-readable name for the user.
* **Formatted Name:** The user's full name, including all middle names, titles, and suffixes, formatted for display.
* **First Name:** The first name of the user.
* **Last Name:** The last name of the user.
* **External ID:** This identifier is generated by an IdP provider.
* **Roles:** This field should contain a string that represents the user's intended role on {% data variables.product.github %}. Valid roles are {% ifversion ghec %}`enterprise_owner`, `user`, `billing_manager`, and `guest_collaborator`{% else %}`enterprise_owner` and `user`{% endif %}.

When you have finished configuring these settings, click **Next**.

### Finish configuration and test

1. On the "Activation & Summary" tab, for the "Channel Status," select **Active**.
1. On the "Manage Channels" tab, click **Done**.
1. On the "Outbound Provisioning" tab, click **Save**. SCIM is now configured and enabled.
1. Wait a few minutes for provisioning to run, then open a new private browser window and navigate to {% data variables.product.github %}.
1. Click **Sign in with SAML**. You should be redirected to the PingFederate login page.
1. You should be able to sign in with the credentials for a user in the LDAP server that has been provisioned to {% data variables.product.github %}.

PingFederate provisioning handles users and groups independently. Users must be assigned directly in order to be provisioned. Users who are in an assigned group but not directly assigned will not be provisioned.

{% ifversion ghes %}

When you have finished configuring SCIM, you may want to disable some SAML settings you enabled for the configuration process. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-users#6-disable-optional-settings).

{% endif %}

## Example of creating an X509 certificate

There are multiple ways to create an X509 certificate. Here is an example that may work for your requirements.

1. In a terminal window, check that OpenSSL is installed by running `openssl version`. If it's not installed, install it.
1. Generate the private key using the following command.

   ```shell copy
   openssl req -nodes -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MyPrivateKey.key -out MyCertificateRequest.csr
   ```

   Enter the required information, and **take note** of the challenge password you create.
1. To ensure the key was created, run the following command. A file named `MyPrivateKey.key` should be listed in the command output.

   ```shell copy
   ls | grep MyPrivateKey.key
   ```

1. Generate the certificate using the following command.

   ```shell copy
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 -in MyCertificateRequest.csr -signkey MyPrivateKey.key -out pfgh256.crt
   ```

1. To ensure the certificate was created, run the following command. A file named `pfgh256.crt` should be listed in the command output.

   ```shell copy
   ls | grep pfgh256.crt
   ```

1. Export a PKCS #12 file using the following command. This is the file you should **upload to PingFederate**.

   ```shell copy
   openssl pkcs12 -export -in pfgh256.crt -inkey MyPrivateKey.key -out pfgh256.p12
   ```

1. To ensure the file was exported, run the following command. A file named `pfgh256.p12` should be listed in the command output.

   ```shell copy
   ls | grep pfgh256.p12
   ```

{% ifversion ghec %}

## Creating a SAML metadata file for {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}

Because some values differ from the metadata file that PingFederate provides for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, you will create an XML file for your enterprise's SAML metadata manually.

1. Copy the following XML into a text editor.

   ```xml copy
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata"
     entityID="https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN" cacheDuration="PT1440M">
     <md:SPSSODescriptor protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"
       AuthnRequestsSigned="false" WantAssertionsSigned="false">
       <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</md:NameIDFormat>
       <md:AssertionConsumerService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
         Location="https://SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/enterprises/SUBDOMAIN/saml/consume" isDefault="true"
         index="0"/>
     </md:SPSSODescriptor>
   </md:EntityDescriptor>
   ```

1. Replace all instances of SUBDOMAIN with your enterprise's subdomain of {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}. For example: `octocorp`.
1. Save the file as an XML file.
1. Return to the instructions in [Creating a SAML adapter](#create-a-saml-adapter).

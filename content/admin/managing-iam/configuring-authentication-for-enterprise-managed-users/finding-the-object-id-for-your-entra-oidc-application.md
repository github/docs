You can adjust the lifetime of a session, and how often a managed user account needs to reauthenticate with your IdP, by changing the lifetime policy property of the ID tokens issued for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} from your IdP. The default lifetime is one hour.  

You will need the object ID associated with your {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} OIDC app to complete these steps. You can find this ID in the Microsoft Entra ID admin center or by using the Microsoft Graph Explorer.

Once you have your object ID, you must use the Microsoft Graph API to configure and assign a lifetime policy to that ID token. See "[Configure token lifetime policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/configure-token-lifetimes#create-a-policy-and-assign-it-to-a-service-principal)" in the Microsoft documentation.

For help completing these steps or configuring the OIDC session lifetime for your IdP, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).

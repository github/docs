## Viewing external identity information for a user

If a user is unable to successfully authenticate using SAML, it may be helpful to view information about the single sign-on identity that's linked to the user's account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/viewing-and-managing-a-users-saml-access-to-your-enterprise#viewing-and-revoking-a-linked-identity)."

{% endif %}

## Username conflicts

{% ifversion ghec %}If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, {% endif %}{% data variables.product.product_name %} normalizes the SCIM `userName` attribute value that is sent by an identity provider (IdP) in a SCIM API call to create each person's username on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. If multiple accounts are normalized into the same {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username, a username conflict occurs, and only the first user account is created. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/username-considerations-for-external-authentication)."

{% ifversion ghec %}

## Errors when switching authentication configurations

If you're experiencing problems while switching between different authentication configurations, such as changing your SAML SSO configuration from an organization to an enterprise account or migrating from SAML to OIDC for {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, ensure you're following our best practices for the change.

* "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/migrating-from-saml-to-oidc)"

## Accessing your enterprise when SSO is not available

When a configuration error or an issue with your identity provider IdP prevents you from using SSO, you can use a recovery code to access your enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-recovery-codes-for-your-enterprise/accessing-your-enterprise-account-if-your-identity-provider-is-unavailable)."

## SCIM provisioning errors

{% data reusables.scim.emu-scim-rate-limit-details %}

Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) will retry SCIM provisioning attempts automatically during the next Entra ID sync cycle. The default SCIM provisioning interval for Entra ID is 40 minutes. For more information about this retry behavior, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/how-provisioning-works#errors-and-retries) or contact Microsoft support if you need additional assistance.

Okta will retry failed SCIM provisioning attempts with manual Okta admin intervention. For more information about how an Okta admin can retry a failed task for a specific application, see the [Okta documentation](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/How-to-retry-failed-tasks-for-a-specific-application?language=en_US) or contact Okta support.
{% endif %}

In an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %} where SCIM is generally functioning properly, individual user SCIM provisioning attempts sometimes fail. Users will be unable to sign in until their account is provisioned to {% data variables.product.github %}. These individual SCIM user provisioning failures result in an HTTP 400 status code and are typically caused by issues with username normalization or username conflicts, where another user with the same normalized username already exists in the enterprise. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/iam-configuration-reference/username-considerations-for-external-authentication)."

## SAML authentication errors

If users are experiencing errors when attempting to authenticate with SAML, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/troubleshooting-saml-authentication)."

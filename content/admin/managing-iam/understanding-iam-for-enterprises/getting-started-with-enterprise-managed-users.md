Before your developers can use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you must follow a series of configuration steps.

## Create a new enterprise account

To use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you need a **separate type of enterprise account** with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} enabled.

Start a free 30-day trial of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, and choose **Enterprise with managed users**. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud)."

## Create the setup user

After we create your enterprise, you will receive an email inviting you to choose a password for the setup user, which is used to configure authentication and provisioning. The username is your enterprise's shortcode suffixed with `_admin`, for example `fabrikam_admin`.

Using an **incognito or private browsing window**:

1. Set the user's password.
1. Save the user's recovery codes.
1. Enable two-factor authentication. See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)."

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-password-reset-session %}

## Create a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}

Next, create a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} that you can use to configure provisioning.

* You must be **signed in as the setup user** when you create the token.
* The token must have at least the **scim:enterprise** scope.
* The token must have **no expiration**.

To learn how to create a {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)."

## Configure authentication

Next, configure how your members will authenticate.

**If you're using Entra ID** as your IdP, you can choose between OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
* We recommend OIDC, which includes support for Conditional Access Policies (CAP).
* If you require multiple enterprises provisioned from one tenant, you must use SAML for each enterprise after the first.

**If you're using another IdP**, like Okta or PingFederate, you must use SAML to authenticate your members.

To get started, read the guide for your chosen authentication method.

* "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/configuring-oidc-for-enterprise-managed-users)"
* "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-with-enterprise-managed-users/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-enterprise-managed-users)"

{% data variables.product.company_short %} offers a "paved-path" integration and full support if you use a partner IdP for both authentication and provisioning. Alternatively, you can use any system, or combination of systems, that conforms to SAML 2.0 and SCIM 2.0. However, support for resolving problems with these systems may be limited. For more details, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users#identity-management-systems)."

## Configure provisioning

After you configure authentication, you can configure SCIM provisioning, which is how your IdP will create {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/configuring-scim-provisioning-for-enterprise-managed-users)."

## Manage organization membership

After authentication and provisioning are configured, you can start managing organization membership for your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %} by synchronizing IdP groups with teams. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/managing-team-memberships-with-identity-provider-groups)."

## Support developers with multiple user accounts

Developers may need to maintain separate, personal accounts for their work outside of your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}. You can help them manage multiple accounts by providing the following resources:

* **On the command line**, developers can configure Git to simplify the process of using multiple accounts. See "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/managing-multiple-accounts)."
* **In the web interface**, developers can switch between accounts without always needing to re-authenticate. See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/switching-between-accounts)."

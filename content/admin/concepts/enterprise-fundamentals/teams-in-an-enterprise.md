## What are teams?

Teams are **groups of users** in an enterprise or organization. By creating teams, you can manage users at scale and simplify access, licensing, and communication. For example, you could create an auditor team for users who need access to audit logs, or a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} team for users who receive {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licenses.

**Enterprise teams** are managed at the enterprise level and can include users from across the enterprise and its organizations. With enterprise teams, you can centralize administration and manage organization access, roles, and licensing at scale.

**Organization teams** are managed at the organization level and can only include members of a single organization. There are certain features of organization teams that are not currently supported for enterprise teams, such as CODEOWNER status.

>[!NOTE] Enterprise teams are in public preview and subject to change.

## Can I manage teams from an identity provider?

If you have integrated {% data variables.product.github %} with an identity provider (IdP), you can link teams on {% data variables.product.github %} with groups in your IdP. When membership of the IdP group changes, the change is reflected in the {% data variables.product.github %} team, allowing you to centralize access management.

The capabilities of this feature depend on whether you use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} or personal accounts.

### {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}

You can make changes to IdP groups to manage repository access, add or remove users from organizations, or grant or remove {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} licenses. For example, if a new user is added to an IdP group that is linked to a team with access to an organization, the user receives access to that organization. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/managing-team-memberships-with-identity-provider-groups#about-team-management-with-enterprise-managed-users).

This feature is available with both enterprise and organization teams.

### Personal accounts

Team synchronization allows you to centrally manage any privileges linked to an organization team, such as repository access and CODEOWNER status. However, team sync cannot be used to add users to organizations where they don't already have access. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/managing-team-synchronization-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise).

Team sync with personal accounts is only available with organization teams, and you must use Entra ID or Okta as an IdP.

## What kind of team should I use?

To simplify administration at scale, {% data variables.product.company_short %} recommends using enterprise teams for any use cases that apply to the enterprise account or to multiple organizations. Organization teams are useful when the need for the team is scoped to a single organization and the team can be managed by an organization administrator.

You may need to create organization teams if the functionality you need is not covered by enterprise teams. {% data variables.product.company_short %} plans to address some limitations in the near future.

{% data reusables.enterprise.enterprise-teams-can %}

However, unlike organization teams, enterprise teams currently do **not** support:

* `@-mentions` of the team name in organizations
* Review requests of the team in pull requests
* Adding the team to a project board
* Team sync if you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with personal accounts
* CODEOWNER status
* Secret teams
* Nested teams
* Team maintainers

{% data reusables.enterprise.enterprise-teams-limits %}

## Next steps

If your needs are covered by enterprise teams, create a team. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/create-enterprise-teams).

If you need to create an organization team, an organization owner must do this from the organization settings. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team).

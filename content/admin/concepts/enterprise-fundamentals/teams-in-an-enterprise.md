## Next steps

If your needs are covered by enterprise teams, create a team. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/create-enterprise-teams).

If you need to create an organization team, an organization owner must do this from the organization settings. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team).

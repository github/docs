## Viewing service status

If you're experiencing problems with a service that usually works, like pull requests or {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, you can check if an ongoing incident is affecting the service in your region. See {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s status page at https://githubstatus.com.

## Getting support

If you need help to resolve an issue, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_ent_support %}. Ensure you are signed in to the support portal with your {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %} account. You can also purchase {% data variables.contact.premium_support %}.

Some requests, such as configuration of an external identity management system, may not be in the scope of what {% data variables.contact.github_support %} can help with. See [AUTOTITLE](/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-support#scope-of-support).

## Giving feedback

We encourage you to engage with your account team to provide feedback about your company's experience on {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}.

## What are enterprise accounts?

<!-- expires 2024-12-31 -->
{% ifversion ghec %}
> [!NOTE] Currently, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} customers who use a single organization are being automatically upgraded to an enterprise account at no additional cost. For details, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-your-enterprise-account/creating-an-enterprise-account#what-will-happen-after-i-upgrade-my-organization).
{% endif %}
<!-- end expires 2024-12-31 -->

An enterprise account enables centralized management for **multiple organizations**.

Administrators for the enterprise account can:

* View and manage enterprise membership
* Manage billing and usage
* Configure security, such as single sign-on, IP allow lists, SSH certificate authorities, and two-factor authentication
* Stream audit and Git events data
* Use internal repositories
* Access features like {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %}
* Enforce policies. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/about-enterprise-policies).

{% ifversion ghec %}

{% data reusables.enterprise.create-an-enterprise-account %} See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-your-enterprise-account/creating-an-enterprise-account).

{% endif %}

## What if I use multiple deployment options?

If you use both {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, you'll have an enterprise account for each.

For the most part, you will manage each enterprise account separately. For example, you will configure the policies and settings for your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance using the enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}.

However, you can also use the enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} to view all license usage across all deployments. This allows you to ensure people with accounts in both environments only consume one user license. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud).

## What if I only use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}?

Even if you **only** use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, we recommend creating an enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. This will make it easier to contact {% data variables.contact.enterprise_support %} and share support bundles with them.

To create an additional enterprise account on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, contact [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s Sales team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact).

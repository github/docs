## When should I create an enterprise account?

{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} allows you to create an enterprise account, which enables collaboration between **multiple organizations** and gives administrators a single point of visibility and management. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-your-enterprise-account/about-enterprise-accounts).

In most cases, you can create an enterprise account **yourself**.

* When you start a free trial of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you'll create an enterprise account as part of the process. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud).
* If you currently use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with a single organization, you can upgrade to an enterprise account by following the steps later in this article.

You'll **need help** creating an enterprise account if you require:

* {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}
* {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency %}
* Invoicing
* A dedicated enterprise for managing {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_for_business %} licenses without adopting {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}

In these cases, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}.

## What will happen after I upgrade my organization?

The following changes also apply to single organizations that are automatically upgraded to an enterprise account. For details, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_blog %}](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-19-upcoming-automatic-upgrade-to-the-enterprise-account-experience/).

* **Ownership transfer:** Your organization will automatically be owned by the enterprise account. For details, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise#about-addition-of-organizations-to-your-enterprise-account).
* **Ownership roles:** All organization owners will become enterprise owners.
* **Billing details:** The organizationâ€™s billing details will now apply to the enterprise account.
* **Billing managers:** All organization billing managers will become enterprise billing managers.
* **Billing process:** {% data variables.product.company_short %} will bill the enterprise account for usage within **all** organizations owned by the enterprise.
* **Enterprise account name:** During the upgrade, the new enterprise account name will match your organization name or be as close as possible if taken. You can rename it after the upgrade.
* **SAML SSO:** Existing SAML SSO will stay at the organization level after being added to the new enterprise account. You can configure SSO at the enterprise level post-upgrade, which will override the organization level. Existing PATs and SAML-authorized tokens will remain unchanged.
* **Policies:** The new enterprise account starts with no policies, so existing organization policies won't be overridden.
* **Spending limits:** Existing organization spending limits transfer to the new enterprise account. Post-upgrade, billing is handled at the enterprise level. To adjust spending limits, under "Settings" in the enterprise account sidebar, select **Billing**.
* **Coupons:** Existing coupons will carry over to the new enterprise account with no interruptions.
* **Workflow permissions:** The new enterprise account will inherit your organization's workflow permissions. If the organization has a permissive setting ("Read and write"), the enterprise account will also default to permissive. Otherwise, it defaults to restrictive ("Read repository contents and packages"). For workflows with the id-token permission, the default changes to read-only due to a February 2023 update. Add an explicit permissions block in these workflows to grant the required permissions.

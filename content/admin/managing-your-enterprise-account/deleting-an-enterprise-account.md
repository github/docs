## About enterprise account deletion

Deleting your enterprise account cancels the enterprise license and removes the enterprise account from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

If there are any outstanding balances on your account, you will be charged a one-time payment when you initiate the deletion process. If you delete your enterprise account partway through a billing cycle, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %} to request a prorated refund for the remainder of the billing cycle.

When you delete your enterprise account, you lose the policies, billing settings, and user roles you've configured. You do not lose data like repositories or packages, unless you choose to delete the organizations that contain that data.

If you want to restore an enterprise account that you have deleted, you must contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.

You can only delete your enterprise account if your company pays by credit card or PayPal. If your company pays via invoice and you want to stop paying for {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} altogether, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}.

If you upgraded to an enterprise account from a single organization and then delete that enterprise account, the associated billing history will also be deleted. We recommend that you save any important billing information before deleting your enterprise account.

## Prerequisites

You must remove, transfer, or delete all organizations in the enterprise before you can delete the enterprise account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise#transferring-an-organization-between-enterprise-accounts)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/removing-organizations-from-your-enterprise)."

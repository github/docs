## About policies for teams in your enterprise

You can enforce policies to control how members of your enterprise on {% data variables.product.product_name %} manage teams. You can also allow organization owners to manage policies for teams. For more information, see "[About teams](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

## Enforcing a policy for team discussions

Across all organizations owned by your enterprise, you can enable or disable team discussions, or allow owners to administer the setting on the organization level. For more information, see "[About team discussions](/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-team-discussions/)."

## Feature releases

Feature releases include new functionality and feature upgrades and typically occur quarterly.

All feature releases begin with at least one release candidate.

## Release candidates

Release candidates are _proposed_ feature releases, with a complete feature set. There may be problems that can only be found by customers actually using the release.

For performance, stability, and security reasons:
* **Do not install a release candidate in a production environment.** Release candidate builds are intended solely for test and staging environments.
* **Do not upgrade to a release candidate from a supported, earlier version.** Instead, install a release candidate in a new, test environment.
* **Do not upgrade from the release candidate to later versions**, including generally available releases. Instead, destroy the release candidate environment.

As you test a release candidate, please provide feedback by contacting support. See "[AUTOTITLE](/support)."

Each new release candidate adds bug fixes for issues found in prior versions. When the release is ready for widespread adoption, {% data variables.product.company_short %} publishes a stable feature release.

## Patch releases

Between feature releases, you can benefit from patch releases, which:

* Consist of hot patches and bug fixes
* Happen more frequently than feature releases
* Are generally available when first released, with no release candidates
* Typically require less than five minutes of downtime

## About exports of audit log and Git events data

You can export the audit log by downloading a JSON or CSV file from your enterprise on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you export audit log events, you can query by one or more of these supported qualifiers to filter for specific log events to export. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/searching-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#search-based-on-the-action-performed)."

The audit log lists events triggered by activities that affect your enterprise within the last 180 days. {% data reusables.audit_log.git-events-retention-period %}

You can export Git events data by downloading a JSON file from your enterprise audit log. Unlike audit log data, you cannot query for specific Git events to filter and export in the audit log user interface.

{% data reusables.audit_log.git-events-export-limited %}

{% data reusables.audit_log.exported-log-keys-and-values %}

As an alternative to exporting log events, you can use the API to retrieve audit log events, or set up {% data variables.product.product_name %} to stream audit data as events are logged. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)."

## Exporting audit log data

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.settings-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.audit-log-tab %}
1. Optionally, to only export filtered results, search by one or more supported qualifiers or log filters.
1. Select the {% octicon "download" aria-hidden="true" %} **Export** dropdown menu, and click a file format.

## Exporting Git events data

You can also export Git events data by date range. The data is exported as a compressed, newline-delimited JSON file.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.settings-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.audit-log-tab %}
1. Select the {% octicon "download" aria-hidden="true" %} **Export Git Events** dropdown menu and choose a date range to export log events for.
1. Click {% octicon "file-zip" aria-hidden="true" %} **Download Results**.
1. To extract the JSON data, uncompress the file using an archive utility client or command. For example:

    ```shell
    gunzip export-avocado-corp-1642896556.json.gz
    ```

## About audit log streaming

You can help protect intellectual property and maintain compliance for your company by using streaming to keep copies of your audit log data. The audit log details events such as changes to settings and access, user membership, app permissions, and more. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise)", "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/audit-log-events-for-your-organization)", and "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events)."

Streaming audit log data has these benefits:

* **Data exploration**. Examine streamed events using your preferred tool for querying large quantities of data. The stream contains both audit events and Git events across the entire enterprise account.{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}
* **Data continuity**. If you pause a stream, it retains a buffer for seven days, so there is no data loss for the first week. If the stream remains paused for more than seven days, it will resume from a point one week prior to the current time. If paused for three weeks or more, the stream won't retain any data and will start anew from the current timestamp.{% endif %}
* **Data retention**. Keep your exported audit logs and Git events data as long as you need to.

You can set up{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}, pause,{% endif %} or delete a stream at any time. The stream exports audit and Git events data for all of the organizations in your enterprise, for activity from the time the stream is enabled onwards.

All streamed audit logs are sent as compressed JSON files. The filename format is in`YYYY/MM/HH/MM/<uuid>.json.gz`.

>[!NOTE] {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} uses an at-least-once delivery method. Due to certain network or system issues, some events may be duplicated.

{% ifversion ghes %}

Enabling audit log streaming can cause a minor impact on the performance of {% data variables.location.product_location %}. To learn about increasing resources to mitigate this performance impact, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources)."

{% endif %}

{% ifversion audit-log-streaming-health-check %}

## Health checks for audit log streams

Every 24 hours, a health check runs for each stream. If a stream is set up incorrectly, an email will be sent to the enterprise owners. To avoid audit log events being dropped from the stream, a misconfigured stream must be fixed within six days.

To fix your streaming configuration, follow the steps in "[Setting up audit log streaming](#setting-up-audit-log-streaming)."

{% endif %}

## Setting up audit log streaming

To set up the audit log stream, follow the instructions for your provider:

* [Amazon S3](#setting-up-streaming-to-amazon-s3)
* [Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-blob-storage)
* [Azure Event Hubs](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs){% ifversion streaming-datadog %}
* [Datadog](#setting-up-streaming-to-datadog){% endif %}
* [Google Cloud Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-google-cloud-storage)
* [Splunk](#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk)

{% ifversion ghec %}

>[!NOTE] To get a list of IP address ranges that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} uses for connections to the streaming endpoint, use the REST API. The `meta` endpoint for {% data variables.product.product_name %} includes a `hooks` key with a list of the IP addresses. See "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/meta/meta#get-github-enterprise-cloud-meta-information)."

{% endif %}

### Setting up streaming to Amazon S3

{% ifversion ghes %}

>[!NOTE] The Amazon region `us-east-1` must be reachable from your appliance for streaming to S3 to work.

{% endif %}

{% ifversion streaming-oidc-s3 %}
You can set up streaming to S3 with access keys or, to avoid storing long-lived secrets in {% data variables.product.product_name %}, with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

{% ifversion streaming-oidc-s3 %}

#### Setting up streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

From AWS:

1. Add the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider to IAM. See [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

   * For the provider URL, use `https://oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com`.
   * For "Audience", use `sts.amazonaws.com`.
{% data reusables.audit_log.create-s3-bucket %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.create-s3-policy %}
1. Configure the role and trust policy for the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} IdP. See [Creating a role for web identity or OpenID Connect Federation (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

   * Add the permissions policy you created earlier to allow writes to the bucket.
   * Edit the trust relationship to add the `sub` field to the validation conditions, replacing `ENTERPRISE` with the name of your enterprise.

     ```json
     "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
           "oidc-configuration.audit-log.githubusercontent.com:sub": "https://github.com/ENTERPRISE"
         }
      }
      ```

   * Make note of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created role.

From {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}:
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-choose-s3 %}
1. Under "Authentication", click **OpenID Connect**.
1. Configure the stream settings.

{% ifversion ghec %}
    - Under "Region", select the bucket's region. For example, `us-east-1`; an option for Auto Discovery is also available.{% endif %}
    - Under "Bucket", type the name of the bucket you want to stream to. For example, `auditlog-streaming-test`.
    - Under "ARN Role" type the ARN role you noted earlier. For example, `arn:aws::iam::1234567890:role/github-audit-log-streaming-role`.
{% data reusables.audit_log.streaming-check-s3-endpoint %}
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

#### Disabling streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect

To disable streaming to S3 with OIDC, delete the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider you created in AWS when you set up streaming. See [Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) in the AWS documentation.

If you disable streaming due to a security vulnerability in OIDC, after you delete the provider, set up streaming with access keys until the vulnerability is resolved. See "[Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-access-keys)."

{% endif %}

#### Integrating with AWS CloudTrail Lake

You can consolidate your audit logs by integrating streaming to S3 with AWS CloudTrail Lake. See the [AWS CloudTrail Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) or the [GitHub Audit Log to CloudTrail Open Audit](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloudtrail-lake-github-audit-log) in the `aws-samples/aws-cloudtrail-lake-github-audit-log` repository.

### Setting up streaming to Azure Blob Storage

> [!NOTE] Audit log streaming to blob storage in Azure Government is not supported.

Before setting up a stream in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, first create a storage account and a container in Microsoft Azure. See [Introduction to Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) in the Microsoft documentation.

To configure the stream, you need the URL of a SAS token.

From the Microsoft Azure portal:
1. On the Home page, click **Storage Accounts**.
1. Under "Name", click the name of the storage account you want to use.
1. Under "Data storage", click **Containers**.
1. Click the name of the container you want to use.
1. In the left sidebar, under "Settings", click **Shared access tokens**.
1. Select the **Permissions** dropdown menu, then select `Create` and `Write` and deselect all other options.
1. Set an expiry date that complies with your secret rotation policy.
1. Click **Generate SAS token and URL**.
1. Copy the value of the **Blob SAS URL** field that's displayed. You will use this URL in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

From {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}:
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown menu and click **Azure Blob Storage**.
1. On the configuration page, enter the blob SAS URL that you copied in Azure. The **Container** field is auto-filled based on the URL.

{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

{% ifversion streaming-datadog %}

### Setting up streaming to Datadog

To set up streaming to Datadog, create a client token or an API key in Datadog, then configure audit log streaming in {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the token for authentication. You do not need to create a bucket or other storage container in Datadog.

After you set up streaming to Datadog, you can see your audit log data by filtering by "github.audit.streaming." See [Log Management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/).

1. If you don't already have a Datadog account, create one.
1. In Datadog, generate a client token or an API key and then click **Copy key**. See [API and Application Keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/) in Datadog Docs.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown and click **Datadog**.
1. In the **Token** field, paste the token you copied earlier.
1. Select the **Site** dropdown and click your Datadog site. To determine your site, compare your Datadog URL to the table in [Datadog sites](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) in Datadog Docs.
1. To verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Datadog endpoint, click **Check endpoint**.
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}
1. After a few minutes, confirm that audit log data appears on the **Logs** tab in Datadog. If it doesn't appear, confirm that your token and site are correct in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.
{% endif %}

### Setting up streaming to Google Cloud Storage

To set up streaming to Google Cloud Storage, create a service account in Google Cloud with the appropriate credentials and permissions, then configure audit log streaming in {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the service account's credentials for authentication.

1. Create a service account for Google Cloud. You do not need to set access controls or IAM roles for this account. See [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Create a JSON key for the service account, and store the key securely. See [Creating and managing service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. If you haven't yet, create a bucket. See [Creating storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the Google Cloud documentation.
1. Give the service account the Storage Object Creator role for the bucket. See [Using Cloud IAM permissions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add) in the Google Cloud documentation.
{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown and click **Google Cloud Storage**.
1. Under "Bucket", type the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.
1. Under "JSON Credentials", paste the entire contents of your service account's JSON key file.
1. To verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Google Cloud Storage bucket, click **Check endpoint**.
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

### Setting up streaming to Splunk

To stream audit logs to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint, make sure that the endpoint is configured to accept HTTPS connections. See [Set up and use HTTP Event Collector in Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) in the Splunk documentation.

>[!NOTE] {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} validates the HEC endpoint via `<Domain>:port/services/collector`. If self-hosting the endpoint (such as with [Splunk HEC Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/splunkhecreceiver) via OpenTelemetry), make sure it's reachable at this destination.

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Select the **Configure stream** dropdown and click **Splunk**.
1. On the configuration page, enter:
   * The domain where the application you want to stream to is hosted.

     If you're using Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `http-inputs-<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example, `http-inputs-mycompany.splunkcloud.com`.

     If you're using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `inputs.<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example, `inputs.mycompany.splunkcloud.com`.

   * The port on which the application accepts data.<br>

     If you're using Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `443`.

     If you're using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `8088`.

   * A token that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can use to authenticate to the third-party application.
1. Leave the **Enable SSL verification** check box selected.

    Audit logs are always streamed as encrypted data, however, with this option selected, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} verifies the SSL certificate of your Splunk instance when delivering events. SSL verification helps ensure that events are delivered to your URL endpoint securely. Verification is optional, but we recommend you leave SSL verification enabled.
1. Click **Check endpoint** to verify that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can connect and write to the Splunk endpoint.
{% data reusables.enterprise.verify-audit-log-streaming-endpoint %}

{% ifversion pause-audit-log-stream %}

## Pausing audit log streaming

Pause the stream to perform maintenance on the receiving application without losing audit data. Audit logs are stored for up to seven days on {% data variables.product.github %} and are then exported when you unpause the stream.

{% ifversion streaming-datadog %}
Datadog only accepts logs from up to 18 hours in the past. If you pause a stream to a Datadog endpoint for more than 18 hours, you risk losing logs that Datadog won't accept after you resume streaming.
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. To the right of your configured stream, click **Pause stream**.
1. A confirmation message displays. Click **Pause stream** to confirm.

To restart streaming, click **Resume stream**.
{% endif %}

## Deleting the audit log stream

{% data reusables.enterprise.navigate-to-log-streaming-tab %}
1. Under "Danger zone", click **Delete stream**.
1. A confirmation message displays. Click **Delete stream** to confirm.

{% ifversion audit-log-streaming-for-api %}

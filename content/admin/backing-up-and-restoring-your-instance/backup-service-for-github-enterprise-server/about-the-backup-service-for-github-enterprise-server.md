## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_service %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_service %} is a managed backup solution built directly into {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. It offers a simplified alternative to the legacy {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_utilities %}.

With this service, you can:

* Configure scheduled backups from the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}.
* View backup status and history.

Compared to the legacy backup utilities, the {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_service %}:

* Can be configured through the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %}.
* Doesn’t require a separate host for backup software.
* Stores backups on a dedicated storage volume directly accessible by your instance.

>[!NOTE] {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_service %} is currently only supported on standalone instances and high availability primary nodes. Cluster configurations and replica nodes are not yet supported.

## How does the backup service differ from a High Availability replica?

While both the backup service and a High Availability (HA) replica contribute to data protection, they serve different purposes and are recommended together for a robust deployment.

### High Availability replica

An HA replica is a redundant, passive {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that stays in sync with the primary instance via datastore replication. It minimizes service disruption during hardware failure or network outages.

However, it’s not a replacement for backups—because any data corruption or loss on the primary can be immediately replicated to the HA node.

### {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise_backup_service %}

The backup service is a disaster recovery solution. It captures full, timestamped snapshots of instance data that can be used to restore an instance or spin up a new one—without needing an always-on replica.

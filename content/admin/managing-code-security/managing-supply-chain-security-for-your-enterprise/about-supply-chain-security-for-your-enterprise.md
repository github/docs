You can allow users to identify their projects' dependencies by enabling the dependency graph for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. For more information, see [Enabling the dependency graph for your enterprise](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-the-dependency-graph-for-your-enterprise).

{% data reusables.dependency-review.dependency-review-enabled-ghes %}

You can also allow users to find and fix vulnerabilities in their code dependencies by enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}{% ifversion ghes %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}{% endif %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise).

After you enable {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}, you can view vulnerability data from the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} and manually sync the data. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/viewing-the-vulnerability-data-for-your-enterprise).

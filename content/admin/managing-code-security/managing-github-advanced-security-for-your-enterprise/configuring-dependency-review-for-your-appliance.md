## About dependency review

{% data reusables.dependency-review.feature-overview %}

Some additional features, such as license checks, blocking of pull requests, and CI/CD integration, are available with the [dependency review action](https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action).

## Checking whether your license includes {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}

{% data reusables.advanced-security.check-for-ghas-license %}

## Prerequisites for dependency review

* A license for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}{% ifversion ghes %} (see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security)").{% endif %}

* The dependency graph enabled for the instance. Site administrators can enable the dependency graph via the management console or the administrative shell (see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-the-dependency-graph-for-your-enterprise)").

* {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} enabled to download and synchronize vulnerabilities from the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. This is usually configured as part of setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} (see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)").

## Enabling and disabling dependency review

To enable or disable dependency review, you need to enable or disable the dependency graph for your instance.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-supply-chain-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-the-dependency-graph-for-your-enterprise)."

## Running dependency review using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

{% data reusables.dependency-review.dependency-review-action-beta-note %}

The dependency review action is included in your installation of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. It is available for all repositories that have {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} and dependency graph enabled.

{% data reusables.dependency-review.dependency-review-action-overview %}

Users run the dependency review action using a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. If you have not already set up runners for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, you must do this to enable users to run workflows. You can provision self-hosted runners at the repository, organization, or enterprise account level. For information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)."

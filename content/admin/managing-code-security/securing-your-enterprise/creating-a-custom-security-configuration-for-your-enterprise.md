## About {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations %}

{% ifversion security-configurations-cloud %}

We recommend securing your enterprise with the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_security_configuration %}, then evaluating the security findings on your repositories before configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-code-security/securing-your-enterprise/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-to-your-enterprise).

{% endif %}

With {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations %}, you can create collections of enablement settings for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s security products to meet the specific security needs of your enterprise. For example, you can create a different {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} for each organization or group of organizations to reflect their unique security requirements and compliance obligations.

{% ifversion security-configurations-ghes-only %}

When creating a security configuration, keep in mind that:
* Only features installed by a site administrator on your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance will appear in the UI.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features will only be visible if your enterprise or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance holds a {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} license.
* Certain features, like {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} default setup, also require that {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} is installed on the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance.

## Creating a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}

{% ifversion security-configurations-cloud %}
<!-- Note: this article has two entirely separate procedures for cloud and server users. -->

>[!NOTE]
> The enablement status of some security features is dependent on other, higher-level security features. For example, disabling dependency graph will also disable automatic dependency submission, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}, vulnerability exposure analysis, and security updates.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.settings-tab %}
1. In the left sidebar, click **Code security**.
1. In the "Configurations" section, click **New configuration**.
1. To help identify your {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} and clarify its purpose on the "Configurations" page, name your configuration and create a description.
1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features" row, choose whether to include or exclude {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} (GHAS) features. If you plan to apply a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} with GHAS features to private repositories, you must have available GHAS licenses for each active unique committer to those repositories, or the features will not be enabled. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security).
1. In the "Dependency graph and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}" section of the security settings table, choose whether you want to enable, disable, or keep the existing settings for the following security features:
    * Dependency graph. To learn about dependency graph, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).{%- ifversion maven-transitive-dependencies %}
    * Automatic dependency submission. To learn about automatic dependency submission, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/configuring-automatic-dependency-submission-for-your-repository).{%- endif %}
    * {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}. To learn about {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts).
    * Security updates. To learn about security updates, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot manually change the enablement settings for vulnerable function calls. If {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} are enabled, vulnerable function calls is also enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled.

1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section of the security settings table, choose whether you want to enable, disable, or keep the existing settings for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} default setup. To learn about default setup, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning#about-default-setup).
1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %}" section of the security settings table, choose whether you want to enable, disable, or keep the existing settings for the following security features:
    * Alerts. To learn about {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning).{% ifversion org-npp-enablement-security-configurations %}
    * Non-provider patterns. To learn more about scanning for non-provider patterns, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#non-provider-patterns) and [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning/viewing-alerts).{% endif %}
    * Push protection. To learn about push protection, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-push-protection).
1. In the "Private vulnerability reporting" section of the security settings table, choose whether you want to enable, disable, or keep the existing settings for private vulnerability reporting. To learn about private vulnerability reporting, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository).
1. Optionally, in the "Policy" section, you can choose to automatically apply the {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configuration %} to newly created repositories depending on their visibility. Select the **None** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click **Public**, **Private and internal**, or **All repositories**.
1. Optionally, in the "Policy" section, you can enforce the configuration and block repository owners from changing features that are enabled or disabled by the configuration (features that are not set aren't enforced). Next to "Enforce configuration", select **Enforce** from the dropdown menu.

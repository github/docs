{% note %}

**Note:** Viewing user-owned repositories is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} for {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, and you've allowed users to create repositories owned by their user accounts, you can view all user-owned repositories within your enterprise.

You can also temporarily access any user-owned repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-repositories-in-your-enterprise/accessing-user-owned-repositories-in-your-enterprise)."

## About temporary access to user-owned repositories

If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, and you've allowed users to create repositories owned by their user accounts, you can temporarily access any user-owned repository within your enterprise.

When you temporarily access a repository, you get admin access to the repository for two hours. You can take all the same actions as the repository owner, including editing the repository, changing the repository's settings, transferring the repository, and deleting the repository.

The repository owner will receive an email informing them that you have enabled temporary access to the repository, and a `repo.temporary_access_granted` event will be added to the audit log for your enterprise and the user's security log.

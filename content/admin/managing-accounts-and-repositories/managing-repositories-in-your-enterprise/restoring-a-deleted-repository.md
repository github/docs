## About repository restoration

Usually, if someone deletes a repository, it will be available on disk for 90 days and can be restored via the site admin dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard)."

Unless a legal hold is in effect on a user or organization, after 90 days the repository is purged and deleted forever.

If a repository was part of a fork network when it was deleted, the restored repository will be detached from the original fork network.

It can take up to an hour after a repository is deleted before that repository is available for restoration.

Restoring a repository will not restore release attachments or team permissions. Issues that are restored will not be labeled.

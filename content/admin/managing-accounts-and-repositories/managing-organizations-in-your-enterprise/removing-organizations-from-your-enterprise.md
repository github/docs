You can remove an organization that is owned by your enterprise account, so the organization stands alone.

## What happens when an organization is removed?

When you remove an organization from your enterprise:

* Billing, identity management, 2FA requirements, and other policies for the organization will no longer be governed by your enterprise.
* The organization will be downgraded to the free plan.
* The organization will be governed by our standard Terms of Service.
* Any internal repositories within the organization will be converted to private repositories.

As part of the downgrade to the free plan:

* Protected branch and ruleset configurations will be retained in your settings, but will no longer be applied in private repositories.
* Existing pull request drafts will remain in draft status. New drafts cannot be created.
* CODEOWNERS files will no longer be applied in private repositories.
* Private {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites will no longer be available.
* Wikis will be retained, but won't be visible unless the organization is upgraded to {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}.
* Secrets will be retained, but will not be accessible in private repositories unless the organization is upgraded to {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}.

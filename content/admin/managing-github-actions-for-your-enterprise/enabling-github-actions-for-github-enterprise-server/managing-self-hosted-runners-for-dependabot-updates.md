## About self-hosted runners for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}

You can help users of {% data variables.location.product_location %} to create and maintain secure code by setting up {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} security and version updates. With {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}, developers can configure repositories so that their dependencies are updated and kept secure automatically. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)."

To use {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %} on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, you must configure self-hosted runners to create the pull requests that will update dependencies.

## Prerequisites

{% ifversion dependabot-updates-github-connect %}
Configuring self-hosted runners is only one step in the middle of the process for enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}. There are several steps you must follow before these steps, including configuring {% data variables.location.product_location %} to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} with self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)."
{% else %}
Before you configure self-hosted runners for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}, you must:

* Configure {% data variables.location.product_location %} to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} with self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server)."
* Enable {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for your enterprise. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise)."
{% endif %}

## Configuring self-hosted runners for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_updates %}

## # System requirements for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} runners

{% data reusables.dependabot.dependabot-runners-system-requirements %}

### Network requirements for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} runners

{% data reusables.dependabot.dependabot-runners-network-requirements %}

### Certificate configuration for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} runners

If your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance uses a self-signed certificate, or if {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} needs to interact with registries that use self-signed certificates, those certificates must also be installed on the self-hosted runners that run {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} jobs. This security hardens the connection. You must also configure Node.js to use the certificate, because most actions are written in JavaScript and run using Node.js, which does not use the operating system certificate store.

### Adding self-hosted runners for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} updates

1. Provision self-hosted runners, at the repository, organization, or enterprise account level. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)."

1. Set up the self-hosted runners with the requirements described above. For example, on a VM running Ubuntu 20.04 you would:
   * Install Docker and ensure that the runner users have access to Docker. For more information, see the Docker documentation.
     * [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
     * Recommended approach: [Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user (Rootless mode)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)
     * Alternative approach: [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   * Verify that the runners have access to the public internet and can only access the internal networks that {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} needs.
   * Install any self-signed certificates for your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance or for registries that {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} will need to interact with.
     * Configure Node.js to use the same certificate. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/advanced-configuration-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-github-actions-for-your-enterprise#configuring-nodejs-to-use-the-certificate)."

1. Assign a `dependabot` label to each runner you want {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to use. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-labels-with-self-hosted-runners#assigning-a-label-to-a-self-hosted-runner)."

1. Optionally, enable workflows triggered by {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to use more than read-only permissions and to have access to any secrets that are normally available. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/advanced-configuration-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-github-actions-for-your-enterprise#providing-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-access-to-secrets-and-increased-permissions)."

## About enterprise policies for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} allows your organizations to financially support developers who build the open source projects you depend on. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor)."

By default, organizations that belong to an enterprise that pays by credit card cannot sponsor open source contributors. You can set a policy to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} for individual organizations in your enterprise.

Organizations that belong to an enterprise that pays by invoice can either pay for sponsorship by invoice or attribute sponsorships using a linked account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/paying-for-github-sponsors-by-invoice)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/attributing-sponsorships-to-your-organization)."

## About policies for projects in your enterprise

You can enforce policies to control how enterprise members manage {% data variables.projects.projects_v2_and_v1 %}, or you can allow organization owners to manage policies for {% data variables.projects.projects_v2_and_v1 %} at the organization level.

{% ifversion projects-v1 %}

Some policies apply to both {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v2 %}, the new projects experience, and {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v1 %}, the previous experience, while some apply only to {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v1 %}. For more information about each experience, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) and [AUTOTITLE](/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards).

{% endif %}

## Enforcing a policy for organization-wide projects

Across all organizations owned by your enterprise, you can enable or disable organization-wide {% data variables.projects.projects_v2 %}, or allow owners to administer the setting on the organization level.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.policies-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.projects-tab %}
1. Under "Organization projects", review the information about changing the setting. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.view-current-policy-config-orgs %}
1. Under "Organization projects", select the dropdown menu and click a policy.

{% ifversion project-visibility-policy %}

## Enforcing a policy for visibility changes to projects

Across all organizations owned by your enterprise, you can enable or disable the ability for people with admin access to a project to change the visibility of the project, or you can allow owners to administer the setting on the organization level.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.policies-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.projects-tab %}
1. Under "Project visibility change permission", review the information about changing the setting. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.view-current-policy-config-orgs %}
1. Select the dropdown menu, then click a policy.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion projects-v1 %}

## Enforcing policies for {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v1 %}

Some policies apply only to {% data variables.product.prodname_projects_v1 %}.

### Enforcing a policy for repository projects

Across all organizations owned by your enterprise, you can enable or disable repository-level projects, or allow owners to administer the setting at the organization level.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.policies-tab %}
{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.projects-tab %}
1. Under "Repository projects", review the information about changing the setting. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.view-current-policy-config-orgs %}
1. Under "Repository projects", select the dropdown menu and click a policy.
{% endif %}

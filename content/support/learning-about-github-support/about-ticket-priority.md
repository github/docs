* {% data variables.product.support_ticket_priority_normal %}
* {% data variables.product.support_ticket_priority_high %}
* {% data variables.product.support_ticket_priority_urgent %} {% ifversion ghec %}([{% data variables.contact.premium_support %}](/support/learning-about-github-support/about-github-premium-support) only){% endif %}

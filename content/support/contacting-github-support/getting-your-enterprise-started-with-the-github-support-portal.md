## About the {% data variables.contact.enterprise_portal %} for enterprises

{% ifversion ghec %}

Anyone can use the {% data variables.contact.contact_landing_page_portal %} to view and manage support tickets about {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, but there are special steps to follow before using the {% data variables.contact.contact_landing_page_portal %} to create tickets about an enterprise account.

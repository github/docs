## About sharing feedback

You can connect with {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Product team and share feedback using {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}. The {% data variables.contact.community_feedback_discussions %} repository is public which means other people can view, upvote, and comment on feedback discussions.

{% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Product team reads and evaluates all feedback received but we can't guarantee a response to every discussion.

## 1. Locating the correct discussion category

Most {% data variables.product.company_short %} product areas have their own feedback discussion category which are monitored by the respective teams at {% data variables.product.company_short %}.

1. In your browser, navigate to https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions.
1. In the list of categories, under "GitHub Product Categories", click on the product area that's relevant for your feedback.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're unsure if a particular category is the correct choice for your feedback, click on it, and read the description that is shown beneath the category name.

## 2. Searching for existing feedback

Before creating a new feedback discussion, you should search for any existing discussions that have raised the same feedback. You can add your voice to the existing feedback by upvoting the discussion or adding a comment providing more context for the Product team.

1. After locating the correct discussion category, type some search terms in the search bar and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

    * For example, if you have feedback about how contributions are displayed on your profile, you could search for "Contributions" in the "Profile" category.

1. Browse the search results and if you find an existing discussion that is similar to your feedback, click the title of the discussion.
1. To add your voice and give more visibility to the discussion, click the upvote arrow at the bottom of the discussion post.

## 3. Creating a new feedback discussion

If there isn't an existing feedback discussion that you can upvote, you can create a new discussion to share your feedback with {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Product team.

1. Above the list of discussions in your chosen category, click **New discussion**.
1. Under "Add a title", type a short summary of your feedback.
1. Under "Select Topic Area", select **Product Feedback**.
1. Under "Body", type your feedback for the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Product team.

    * Include as much information as possible to help the team understand your feedback.
    * If your feedback is related to a specific scenario or workflow, include information about what you were trying to do.
    * You can also include screenshots to demonstrate what your feedback is about.

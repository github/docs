To help you get started, this guide shows you some basic examples. For the full GitHub Actions documentation on workflows, see "Configuring workflows."
Customizing when workflow runs are triggered
Set your workflow to run on push events to the main and release/* branches
-on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
    - release/*
Set your workflow to run on pull_request events that target the main branch

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - main
Set your workflow to run every day of the week from Monday to Friday at 2:00 UTC

on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0 2 * * 1-5"
For more information, see "Events that trigger workflows."

Manually running a workflow
To manually run a workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."

Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:

jobs:
  my_job:
    name: deploy to staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:

ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."

Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.

To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.

- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: '10.x'
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.

For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run across 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: ['8', '10', '12']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}

    - name: npm install, build and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present
        npm test
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context.
For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:
steps:
- run: npm publish
  if: github.event_name'' '=''='' 'Pulls'Request':'' '"build-and-deployee'@Action.js/Checks-out :repositories/dispatch'@Octocokit'@intuit/config/install/unit/content/ci/tests/travis :''

  pull_request:

Greetings dear beneficiary, how are you doing today, I hope all is well with you. Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund.

 

  NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice.

 

  Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours.

 

NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

 

In anticipating for your urgent cooperation

 

Thank you, God Bless America.

 

Mr Jamie Dimon,

Director Of Foreign Remittance Department.

## About migration from the Docker registry

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-replaces-docker-registry %} If you've stored Docker images in the Docker registry, {% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}an enterprise owner{% else %}{% data variables.product.company_short %}{% endif %} will gradually migrate the images to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}. No action is required on your part.

{% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}

{% note %}

**Note**: {% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-ghes-migration-availability %} For more information about finding the version of {% data variables.product.product_name %} that you use, see "[About versions of {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %}](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-versions-of-github-docs#github-enterprise-server)."

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

After a Docker image has been migrated to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, you'll see the following changes to the details for the package.

- The icon will be the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} logo instead of the Docker logo.
- The domain in the pull URL will be {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry_namespace %} instead of {% data variables.product.prodname_docker_registry_namespace %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

![Screenshot of a Docker image migrated to the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}](/assets/images/help/package-registry/container-registry-details-page.png)

{% endif %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-migration-namespaces %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

After migration, you'll no longer be able to use the GraphQL API to query for packages with a `PackageType` of "DOCKER". Instead, you can use the REST API to query for packages with a `package_type` of "container". For more information, see "[Packages](/rest/reference/packages)" in the REST API documentation.

## About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}

For more information about billing for the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-packages/about-billing-for-github-packages)."

{% "var" %}

{% ifversion docker-ghcr-enterprise-migration %}

### Authenticating to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-packages %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-packages-github-token %}

#### Authenticating with a personal access token

{% data reusables.package_registry.required-scopes %}

You can authenticate to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} with Apache Maven by editing your *~/.m2/settings.xml* file to include your personal access token. Create a new *~/.m2/settings.xml* file if one doesn't exist.

In the `servers` tag, add a child `server` tag with an `id`, replacing *USERNAME* with your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username, and *TOKEN* with your personal access token.

In the `repositories` tag, configure a repository by mapping the `id` of the repository to the `id` you added in the `server` tag containing your credentials. Replace {% if enterpriseServerVersions contains currentVersion or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}*HOSTNAME* with the host name of {% data variables.product.product_location %}, and{% endif %} *OWNER* with the name of the user or organization account that owns the repository. Because uppercase letters aren't supported, you must use lowercase letters for the repository owner even if the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user or organization name contains uppercase letters.

If you want to interact with multiple repositories, you can add each repository to separate `repository` children in the `repositories` tag, mapping the `id` of each to the credentials in the `servers` tag.

```
{% endif %}

### Publishing a package

{% data reusables.package_registry.default-name %} For example, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will publish a package named `com.example:test` in a repository called `OWNER/test`.

If you would like to publish multiple packages to the same repository, you can include the URL of the repository in the `<distributionManagement>` element of the *pom.xml* file. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will match the repository based on that field. Since the repository name is also part of the `distributionManagement` element, there are no additional steps to publish multiple packages to the same repository.

For more information on creating a package, see the [maven.apache.org documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html).

1. Edit the `distributionManagement` element of the *pom.xml* file located in your package directory, replacing {% if enterpriseServerVersions contains currentVersion or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}*HOSTNAME* with the host name of {% data variables.product.product_location %}, {% endif %}`OWNER` with the name of the user or organization account that owns the repository and `REPOSITORY` with the name of the repository containing your project.{% if enterpriseServerVersions contains currentVersion %}

  If your instance has subdomain isolation enabled:{% endif %}
  ```xml
  <distributionManagement>
     <repository>
       <id>github</id>
       <name>GitHub OWNER Apache Maven Packages</name>
       <url>https://{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}maven.pkg.github.com{% else %}maven.HOSTNAME{% endif %}/OWNER/REPOSITORY</url>
     </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
  ```{% if enterpriseServerVersions contains currentVersion %}
  If your instance has subdomain isolation disabled:
  ```xml
  <distributionManagement>
     <repository>
       <id>github</id>
       <name>GitHub OWNER Apache Maven Packages</name>
       <url>https://HOSTNAME/_registry/maven/OWNER/REPOSITORY</url>
     </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
  ```{% endif %}
{% data reusables.package_registry.checksum-maven-plugin %}
1. Publish the package.
   ```shell
   $ mvn deploy
  ```

{% data reusables.package_registry.viewing-packages %}

### Installing a package

To install an Apache Maven package from {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, edit the *pom.xml* file to include the package as a dependency. If you want to install packages from more than one repository, add a `repository` tag for each. For more information on using a *pom.xml* file in your project, see "[Introduction to the POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)" in the Apache Maven documentation.

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate-step %}
2. Add the package dependencies to the `dependencies` element of your project *pom.xml* file, replacing `com.example:test` with your package.

  ```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>test</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```
{% data reusables.package_registry.checksum-maven-plugin %}
3. Install the package.

  ```shell
  $ mvn install
  ```

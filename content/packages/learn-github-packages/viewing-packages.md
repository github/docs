## About package views

Your ability to view a package depends on several factors. By default, you can view all packages you have published.

{% ifversion packages-registries-v2 %}
Repository-scoped packages inherit their permissions and visibility from the repository in which the package is published. Some registries **only** support repository-scoped packages. For a list of these registries, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

Other registries offer you the option of granular permissions and visibility settings that can be customized for each package scoped to a personal account or organization. You can choose to use granular permissions or connect the package to a repository and inherit the repository's permissions. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/connecting-a-repository-to-a-package)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)."

{% else %}

Packages inherit their permissions and visibility from the repository on which they are hosted. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages)."

{% endif %}

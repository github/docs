You can block non-members from within your organization's settings or from a specific comment made by a user. When you block a user in a comment, you can choose to send the user a notification explaining that they were blocked and why. Otherwise, the user is not directly notified that you've blocked them. Blocked users can still delete their existing content.

{% data reusables.organizations.blocking-a-user %}

{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

{% endtip %}

At the time that you block a user from your organization:
* The user stops watching your organization's repositories
* The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories
* The user's votes on discussions or comments in your organization's repositories are deleted
* The user is removed as a collaborator on your organization's repositories
* The user's contributions to your organization's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them
* Any pending repository or organization invitations to the blocked user are canceled

After you've blocked a user from your organization, they cannot:
* Cross-reference your organization's repositories in comments
* Fork, watch, pin, or star your organization's repositories

In your organization's repositories, blocked users also cannot:
* Open issues
* Send, close, or merge pull requests
* Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
* Add or edit wiki pages

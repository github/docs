When you unblock a user, they'll be able to invite you to be a collaborator to their repositories. If they [@mention you](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) anywhere on GitHub, you'll receive notifications.

In repositories you own, the user will be able to collaborate normally.

You can unblock a user in your account settings or from the user's profile page.

## Unblocking a user in your account settings

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.blocked_users %}
1. Under "Blocked users", next to the user you'd like to unblock, click **Unblock**.

## Unblocking a user from their profile page

{% data reusables.profile.user_profile_page_navigation %}
1. In the left sidebar, below the user's profile information, click  **Unblock or report user**.

   ![Screenshot of the sidebar of a user's profile page. A link, labeled "Unblock or report", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/profile/profile-unblock-or-report-user.png)
1. Click **Unblock user**.

{% tip %}

**Tip**: Settings that were removed when you blocked the user, such as collaborator status, stars, and follows, are not restored when you unblock the user.

{% endtip %}

You can apply the `good first issue` label to issues in your public repository so that people can find them when searching by labels. For more information about searching by labels, see [AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label).

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} uses an algorithm to determine the most approachable issues in each repository and surface them in various places on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. Adding the `good first issue` label can increase the likelihood that your issues are surfaced.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-issues %}
{% data reusables.repositories.select-items-in-issue-or-pr-list %}

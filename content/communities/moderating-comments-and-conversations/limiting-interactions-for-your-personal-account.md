## About temporary interaction limits

Limiting interactions for your personal account enables temporary interaction limits for all public repositories owned by your personal account. {% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-restrictions %}

{% data reusables.community.interaction-limits-duration %} After the duration of your limit passes, users can resume normal activity in your public repositories.

{% data reusables.community.types-of-interaction-limits %}

When you enable user-wide activity limitations, you can't enable or disable interaction limits on individual repositories. For more information on limiting activity for an individual repository, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository)."

You can also block users. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account)."

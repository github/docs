Every repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %} comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to  share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)."

With wikis, you can write content just like everywhere else on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)." We use [our open-source Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup) to convert different formats into HTML, so you can choose to write in Markdown or any other supported format.

If you create a wiki in a public repository, the wiki is available to {% ifversion ghes %}anyone with access to {% data variables.location.product_location %}{% else %}the public{% endif %}. If you create a wiki in a private{% ifversion ghec or ghes %} or internal{% endif %} repository, only people with access to the repository can access the wiki. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility)."

You can edit wikis directly on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or you can edit wiki files locally. By default, only people with write access to your repository can make changes to wikis, although you can allow everyone on {% data variables.location.product_location %} to contribute to a wiki in a public repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% note %}

**Note:** Search engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis)."

If you need search engines to index your content, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} in a public repository. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}](/pages)."

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% note %}

**Note:** For performance reasons, wikis have a soft limit of 5,000 total files, regardless of file type. If you exceed this limit, some pages may be inaccessible to users. If you need a larger wiki, we recommend using {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}](/pages)."

{% endnote %}

## About {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites in the [{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} examples collection](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples).

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
You can host your site on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s `github.io` domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% data reusables.pages.about-private-publishing %} For more information, see "[Changing the visibility of your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site]({% ifversion fpt %}/enterprise-cloud@latest{% endif %}/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site){% ifversion fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}
{% endif %}

To get started, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)."

Organization owners can disable the publication of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-publication-of-github-pages-sites-for-your-organization)."

## Types of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites

There are three types of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}.

To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your personal account that's named {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}`<username>.github.io`{% else %}`<username>.<hostname>`{% endif %}. To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}`<organization>.github.io`{% else %}`<organization>.<hostname>`{% endif %}. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io` or `http(s)://<organization>.github.io`.{% endif %}

The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Unless you're using a custom domain, project sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository>` or `http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>`.{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}
If you publish your site privately, the URL for your site will be different. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)."
{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
For more information about how custom domains affect the URL for your site, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-a-custom-domain-across-multiple-repositories)."
{% endif %}

You can only create one user or organization site for each account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Project sites, whether owned by an organization or a personal account, are unlimited.

{% ifversion ghes %}
The URL where your site is available depends on whether subdomain isolation is enabled for {% data variables.location.product_location %}.

| Type of site | Subdomain isolation enabled | Subdomain isolation disabled |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
User | `http(s)://pages.<hostname>/<username>` | `http(s)://<hostname>/pages/<username>` |
Organization | `http(s)://pages.<hostname>/<organization>` | `http(s)://<hostname>/pages/<organization>` |
Project site owned by personal account | `http(s)://pages.<hostname>/<username>/<repository>/` | `http(s)://<hostname>/pages/<username>/<repository>/`
Project site owned by organization account | `http(s)://pages.<hostname>/<orgname>/<repository>/` | `http(s)://<hostname>/pages/<orgname>/<repository>/`

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/enabling-subdomain-isolation)" or contact your site administrator.

## Limitations for {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}

If you're a {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %}, your use of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} is limited.

* {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites can only be published from repositories owned by organizations.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites are always privately published, and you cannot change this visibility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)."
* You cannot create an organization site (a site published from a repository named `<organization>.github.io`)

For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users)."
{% endif %}

## Static site generators

{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} publishes any static files that you push to your repository. You can create your own static files or use a static site generator to build your site for you. You can also customize your own build process locally or on another server.

If you use a custom build process or a static site generator other than Jekyll, you can write a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to build and publish your site. {% data variables.product.product_name %} provides workflow templates for several static site generators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)."

If you publish your site from a source branch, {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} will use Jekyll to build your site by default. If you want to use a static site generator other than Jekyll, we recommend that you write a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to build and publish your site instead. Otherwise, disable the Jekyll build process by creating an empty file called `.nojekyll` in the root of your publishing source, then follow your static site generator's instructions to build your site locally.

{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.

## Limits on use of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites created after June 15, 2016, and using `github.io` domains are served over HTTPS. If you created your site before June 15, 2016, you can enable HTTPS support for traffic to your site. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https)."

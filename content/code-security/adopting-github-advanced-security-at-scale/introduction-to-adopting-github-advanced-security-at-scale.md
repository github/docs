## About these articles

{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} (GHAS) helps teams build more secure code faster using integrated tooling such as secret scanning and code scanning using {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}. To understand the security features available through {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security)."

GHAS is a suite of tools that requires active participation from developers across your enterprise. To realize the best return on your investment, you must learn how to use, apply, and maintain GHAS.

Weâ€™ve created a phased approach to GHAS rollouts developed from industry and GitHub best practices. We expect most customers will want to follow these phases, based on our experience helping customers with a successful deployment of {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, but you may need to modify this approach to meet the needs of your company.

Enabling GHAS across a large organization can be broken down into six core phases.

1. [Align on your rollout strategy and goals](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-1-align-on-your-rollout-strategy-and-goals): Think about what success will look like, and align on how GHAS will be implemented in your company. This phase may only take a few days or a week, but it lays a solid foundation for the rest of the rollout.

1. [Preparing to enable at scale](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-2-preparing-to-enable-at-scale): Prepare developers, collect data about your repositories, and ensure you're ready for the next phase.

1. [Pilot programs](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-3-pilot-programs): Optionally, pilot an initial rollout to a few high-impact projects and teams. This will allow an initial group within your company to get familiar with GHAS before you roll out to the remainder of your company.

1. [Create internal documentation](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-4-create-internal-documentation): Create and communicate internal documentation for the consumers of GHAS. Without proper documentation provided to developers, security engineers, and others who will be using GHAS, the value will get lost in the rollout.

1. [Rollout and scale {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-5-rollout-and-scale-code-scanning): Leveraging the available APIs, automatically rollout {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} by team and by language across your enterprise, using the repository data you collected earlier.

1. [Rollout and scale {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}](/code-security/adopting-github-advanced-security-at-scale/phase-6-rollout-and-scale-secret-scanning): Roll out {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}, which involves less configuration and is therefore simpler to adopt than {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. Still, it's critical to have a strategy for handling new and old results.

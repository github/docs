## Understanding why your pull request is blocked

Repository administrators can set code quality gates for maintainability and reliability using {% data variables.product.prodname_code_quality %}. When you open a pull request, a scan automatically runs to check your changes against these standards.

If your pull request introduces code that falls below the required quality threshold, youâ€™ll see a merge block banner at the bottom of the pull request in the Checks section:
"Merging is blocked: Code quality findings were detected."

These checks help maintain a healthy, maintainable codebase and prevent technical debt from accumulating.

## Viewing scan results and their severity levels

The results of the scan are reported as comments on your pull request, left by the `{% data variables.code-quality.pr_commenter %}`. Each comment corresponds to a specific code quality problem that was detected in your changes.

Comments are labeled by severity (**Error**, **Warning**, **Note**). To learn more about what the severity levels mean, see [Severity levels](/code-security/code-quality/reference/metrics-and-ratings#severity-levels).

## Determining which findings are blocking your pull request

The quality gate set by repository administrators defines the **minimum severity level** that will block merging.

The merge block banner may specify the minimum severity level. All findings at that severity level or higher must be addressed before you can merge your pull request.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see a severity level defined in the merge block banner, it means that your repository is using the most stringent code quality thresholds, which require **all findings** to be addressed before merging.

## Fixing or dismissing each finding

In order to unblock your pull request, you need to resolve each required finding by deciding whether to **fix** the issue in your code or **dismiss** the comment.

### Leveraging {% data variables.copilot.copilot_autofix_short %} and {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} to fix findings

#### {% data variables.copilot.copilot_autofix_short %}

{% data reusables.code-quality.fix-findings-with-copilot-autofix %}

#### {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}

{% data reusables.code-quality.fix-findings-with-coding-agent %}

### Dismissing the finding

{% data reusables.code-quality.dismiss-irrelevant-findings %}

## Verifying that you've met the requirements

To see if you've met the code quality requirements, look at the "Checks" section at the bottom of your pull request. The merge block banner should no longer be present, and you should be able to merge your changes as usual.

## Next steps

Reduce technical debt by fixing findings in recently changed files. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-quality/tutorials/improve-recent-merges).

## About choosing a {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configuration %}

{% data reusables.security-configurations.define-security-configurations %} {% data variables.product.company_short %} offers two types of {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configurations %}:

* The {% data variables.product.prodname_github_security_configuration %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configurations_caps %}

_We recommend that organizations initially apply the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_security_configuration %}_. After you have applied the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_security_configuration %} to repositories in your organization, you can evaluate the security findings for each repository and determine if you instead want to create and apply a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}.

Once you have identified security alerts in the default branches of your repositories, the next step is to identify the most urgent alerts and get them fixed. Security campaigns are a way to group alerts and share them with developers, so you can collaborate to remediate vulnerabilities in the code.

## Security campaigns in your day-to-day work

You can use security campaigns to support many of your aims as a security leader.

* Improving the security posture of the company by leading work to remediate alerts.
* Reinforcing security training for developers by creating a campaign of related alerts to fix collaboratively.
* Building collaborative relationships between the security team and developers to promote shared ownership of security alerts.
* Providing clarity to developers on the most urgent alerts to fix and monitoring alert remediation.

## Benefits of using security campaigns

A security campaign has many benefits over other ways of encouraging developers to remediate security alerts. In particular,

* Developers are notified about any security campaigns taking place in repositories they work in or subscribe to (by email during the {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %}).
* Developers can see the alerts you've highlighted for remediation without leaving their normal workflows.
* Each campaign has a named point of contact for questions, reviews, and collaboration.  {% ifversion security-campaigns-autofix %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix %} is automatically triggered to suggest a resolution for each security alert. {% endif %}

In addition, you can use one of the templates to select a group of closely related alerts for a campaign. This allows developers to build on the knowledge gained by resolving one alert and use it to fix several more, providing them with an incentive to fix multiple alerts.

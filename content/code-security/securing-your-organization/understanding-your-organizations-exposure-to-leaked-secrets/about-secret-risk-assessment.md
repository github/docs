## About exposure to leaked secrets

Assessing your exposure to leaked secrets is crucial if you want to prevent:

* **Exploitation by bad actors**. Malicious actors can use leaked secrets such as API keys, passwords, and tokens to gain unauthorized access to systems, databases, and sensitive information. If secrets are leaked, it can lead to data breaches, compromising user data and potentially causing significant financial and reputational damage.

* **Regulatory problems**. Many industries have strict regulatory requirements for data protection, and leaked secrets can result in non-compliance with regulations, leading to legal penalties and fines.

* **Service disruptions**. Unauthorized access to systems can lead to service disruptions, impacting the availability and reliability of services provided to users.

* **Loss of trust**. Customers expect robust security measures to protect their data, and exposure to leaked secrets can erode trust and confidence in your organization's ability to safeguard information.

* **Costly fallout**. Addressing the fallout from leaked secrets can be costly, involving incident response efforts, security audits, and potential compensation for affected parties.

Regularly assessing your exposure to leaked secrets is good practice to help identify vulnerabilities, implement necessary security measures, and ensure that any compromised secrets are promptly rotated and invalidated.

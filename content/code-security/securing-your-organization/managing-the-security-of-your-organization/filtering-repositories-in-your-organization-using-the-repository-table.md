## About filtering repositories in your organization

By default, when managing {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configurations %} for repositories in your organization, the repository table displays all repositories in your organization. You can filter the repository table to help you apply and detach {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configurations %}, as well as manage {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} license usage in your organization.

## Filtering the repository table with the search bar

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.security-configurations.view-configurations-page %}
1. In the "Apply configurations" section, use the **Search repositories** search bar to filter repositories in your organization in one of two ways:
    * Find repositories by name with free-text search
    * Select filters from the dropdown menu that appears once you click the search bar

## Filtering the repository table with the advanced filter builder

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.security-configurations.view-configurations-page %}
1. To open the advanced filter dialog, in the "Apply configurations" section, click **{% octicon "filter" aria-hidden="true" %} Filter**.
1. In the "Advanced filters" window, select the **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" %} Add a filter** dropdown menu, then click a filter.
1. To search for repositories matching the selected filter, fill out the available fields for that filter, then click **Apply**. You can repeat this process to add as many filters as you would like to your search.
1. Optionally, to remove a filter from your search, click **{% octicon "filter" aria-hidden="true" %} Filter**. In the row of the filter you want to remove, click {% octicon "x" aria-label="Delete FILTER-NUMBER: FILTER-PROPERTIES" %}, then click **Apply**.

If you no longer need a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}, you can delete that configuration to ensure it will not be applied to any repositories in the future. If you are deleting a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} because you want to change the security enablement settings in that configuration, you can instead edit the configuration.

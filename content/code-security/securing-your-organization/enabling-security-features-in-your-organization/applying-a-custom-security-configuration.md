## About applying a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}

After you create a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}, you need to apply it to repositories in your organization to enable the configuration's settings on those repositories. To learn how to create a {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/creating-a-custom-security-configuration).

## Applying your {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} to repositories in your organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.security-configurations.view-configurations-page %}
1. Optionally, in the "Apply configurations" section, filter for specific repositories you would like to apply your {% data variables.product.prodname_custom_security_configuration %} to. To learn how to filter the repository table, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/managing-the-security-of-your-organization/filtering-repositories-in-your-organization-using-the-repository-table).
1. In the repository table, select repositories with one of three methods:
     * Select each repository you would like to apply the {% data variables.product.prodname_security_configuration %} to.
     * To select all repositories displayed on the current page of the repository table, select **NUMBER repositories**.
     * After selecting **NUMBER repositories**, to select _all_ repositories in your organization that match any filters you have applied, click **Select all**.
     >[!NOTE]
     > The repository table will show which repositories have an enforced configuration. This means that repository owners will be blocked from changing features that have been enabled or disabled in the configuration, but features that are not set aren't enforced.
1. Select the **Apply configuration** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click **YOUR-CONFIGURATION-NAME**.

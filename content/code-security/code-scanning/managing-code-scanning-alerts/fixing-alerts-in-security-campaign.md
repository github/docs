## Viewing alerts in a security campaign

When a campaign targets security alerts in a repository that you have write access to, you can navigate to the list of repository alerts in the campaign.

* Display the **Security** tab for the repository and click one of the campaigns under "Campaigns" in the sidebar.
* If you have enabled email notifications for "All activity" or "Security alerts" in the repository, click **View security campaign** in the campaign email.
* If you have write access to more than one repository in the organization, display the **Security** tab for the organization and click one of the campaigns under "Campaigns" in the sidebar.

This view shows the alerts in the current repository for a campaign called "SQL injection (CWE-89)" (highlighted gray) that is managed by "octocat" (outlined in dark orange).

## Fixing alerts in a security campaign

If you want to see the code that triggered the security alert and the suggested fix, click on the alert name to show the alert view.

1. When you are ready to work on one or more security alerts, check that no one else is working on those alerts already. In the campaign view, git icons are displayed on alerts where a fix may already be in progress. Click an icon to display the linked work:
   * {% octicon "git-pull-request-draft" aria-hidden="Draft pull request" %} an open draft pull request may fix this alert.
   * {% octicon "git-pull-request" aria-label="Pull request" %} an open pull request may fix this alert.
   * {% octicon "git-branch" aria-label="Branch" %} a branch may contain changes to fix this alert.

1. In the campaign view for the repository, select the alerts that you want to fix.{% ifversion security-campaigns-autofix %}
1. Connect the security alerts to a working branch:
   * If at least one "Autofix" suggestion is available for the selected alerts, click **Commit autofix** and commit the changes either to a new branch or to an existing branch.
   * If no autofix suggestions are available for the selected alerts, click **Create new branch** to create a new branch where you will work on fixing the alerts.{% elsif ghes %}
1. Click **Create new branch** to create a new branch where you will work on fixing the alerts.{% endif %}
1. When you have finished fixing the alerts and testing your solutions, create a pull request for your changes and request a review from the campaign manager.

> [!TIP] If you have write permission for more than one repository in the campaign, click the link in the "Campaign progress" box in your repository to show the organization-level view of the campaign. When you open a repository from this view, the campaign alerts view is displayed.

## Using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} for secure coding

If you have access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} then you can ask the AI questions about the vulnerability, the suggested fix, and how to test that the fix is comprehensive.

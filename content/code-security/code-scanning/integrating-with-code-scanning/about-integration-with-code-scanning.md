## About integration with code scanning

{% data reusables.code-scanning.enterprise-enable-code-scanning %}

As an alternative to running {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} within {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can perform analysis elsewhere, using the CodeQL CLI or another static analysis tool, and then upload the results. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/using-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system)."

## Integrations with webhooks

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} webhooks to build or configure integrations, such as [{% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app) or [{% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps), that subscribe to {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} events in your repository. For example, you could build an integration that creates an issue on {% data variables.product.product_name %} or sends you a Slack notification when a new {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alert is added in your repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#code_scanning_alert)."

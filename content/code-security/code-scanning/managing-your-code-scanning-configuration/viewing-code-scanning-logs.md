## About your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configuration

You can use a variety of tools to configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} in your repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning)."

The log and diagnostic information available to you depends on the method you use for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} in your repository. You can check the type of {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} you're using in the **Security** tab of your repository, by using the **Tool** drop-down menu in the alert list. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/assessing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."

## About analysis and diagnostic information

You can see analysis and diagnostic information for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} run using {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analysis on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

Analysis information is shown for the most recent analysis in a header at the top of the list of alerts. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/assessing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."

Diagnostic information is displayed in the Action workflow logs and consists of summary metrics and extractor diagnostics. For information about accessing {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} logs on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, see "[Viewing the logging output from {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}](#viewing-the-logging-output-from-code-scanning)" below.

If you're using the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %} outside {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you'll see diagnostic information in the output generated during database analysis. This information is also included in the SARIF results file you upload to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} with the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} results.

For information about the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/analyzing-your-code-with-codeql-queries#viewing-log-and-diagnostic-information)."

## About this error

```text
A GitHub token is required to upload SARIF results but none was specified
```

This error is reported if the upload process does not reference an authentication method, or if that method has the wrong permission. The permissions required to upload SARIF file to a repository are the same no matter what process you use to upload the data.

* Fine-grained {% data variables.product.pat_generic_plural %} require `write` scope for the repository.
* Classic {% data variables.product.pat_generic_plural %} require `security_events` scope for the repository{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} for private or internal repositories. You can use tokens with the `public_repo` scope for public repositories.{% endif %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} require `security_events` scope for the repository.

You could see this error for SARIF files created using any tool and uploaded using any method.

## Fixing the problem

Create a new {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} with the correct permission.

## About privately reporting a security vulnerability

Private vulnerability reporting makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to you using a simple form.

When a security researcher reports a vulnerability privately, you are notified and can choose to either accept it, ask more questions, or reject it. If you accept the report, you're ready to collaborate on a fix for the vulnerability in private with the security researcher.

For more information about configuring notification preferences, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository#configuring-notifications-for-private-vulnerability-reporting)."

1. Click the advisory you want to review. An advisory that was reported privately has a status of `Triage`.

1. Carefully review the report, then choose how to proceed.
   * To collaborate on a patch in private, click **Start a temporary private fork** to create a place for further discussions with the contributor. This does not change the status of the proposed advisory from `Triage`.
   * To accept the reported vulnerability, click **Accept and open as draft** to accept the vulnerability report as a draft advisory on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. If you choose this option:
      * This doesn't make the report public.
      * The report becomes a draft repository security advisory and you can work on it in the same way as any draft advisory that you create.
     For more information on security advisories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)."
   * To ask for more information, or to open a discussion with the reporter, you can comment on the advisory. Any comments are visible only to the reporter and to any collaborators on the advisory.
   * If you have enough information to determine that the problem the reporter describes is not a security risk, click **Close security advisory**. Where possible, you should add a comment explaining why you don't consider the report a security risk before you close the advisory.

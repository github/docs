Anyone with admin permissions to a public repository can create and edit a security advisory.

## About security advisories for repositories

{% data reusables.security-advisory.security-advisory-overview %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)."

We recommend you use the syntax used in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, especially the version formatting, when you write a repository security advisory, or make a community contribution to a global security advisory.

If you follow the syntax for the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, especially when you define affected versions:
* When you publish your repository advisory, we can add your advisory to the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} as a "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisory, without needing to ask for more information.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} will have the information to accurately identify repositories that are affected and send them {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} to notify them.
* Community members are less likely to suggest edits to your advisory to fix missing or incorrect information.

You add or edit a repository advisory using the _Draft security advisory_ form. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)."

You suggest an improvement to an existing global advisory using the _Improve security advisory_ form. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)."

## Ecosystem

You need to assign the advisory to one of our supported ecosystems using the **Ecosystem** field. For more information about the ecosystems we support, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#github-reviewed-advisories)."

![Screenshot of the "Affected products" area of the security advisory form. The "Ecosystem" field is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/security-advisory-ecosystem.png)

## Package name

We recommend that you use the **Package name** field to specify which packages are affected because package information is required for "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. Package information is optional for repository-level security advisories, but including this information early simplifies the review process when you publish your security advisory.

## Affected versions

We recommend that you use the **Affected versions** field to specify which versions are affected because this information is required for "{% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed" advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. Version information is optional for repository-level security advisories, but including this information early simplifies the review process when you publish your security advisory.

For more information about the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, see [https://github.com/github/advisory-database](https://github.com/github/advisory-database).

### Glossary

* **Vulnerable Version Range (VVR)**: the range of versions that are vulnerable to a particular software bug.
* **Operator**: any symbol that indicates the boundary of a vulnerable version range.
* **Open Source Vulnerability format (OSV)**: format that the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} data strives to be compatible with.

### Version syntax

* Smaller numbers are earlier versions than larger numbers. for example, `1.0.0` is a lower version than `2.0.0`
* Earlier letters in the alphabet are earlier versions than later letters in the alphabet. For example, `2.0.0-a` is an earlier version than `2.0.0-b`.
* Any letters that come after a number are considered part of a prerelease, so any versions with letters after the numbers are earlier versions than numbers without letters in the version number. For example,  `2.0.0-alpha`, `2.0.0-beta`, and `2.0.0-rc` are earlier than `2.0.0`.
* A fixed version cannot be smaller than the largest number in the VVR. For example, a vulnerable version is released and the maintainer recommends downgrading. The maintainer cannot label that lower version as a fixed or patched version in the `Fixed` field because that version is smaller than the vulnerable version.

### Supported operators

* `>=` for “greater than or equal to this version”.
* `>` for “greater than this version”.

   >[!WARNING] Although {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} supports the use of the `>` operator, using this operator is not recommended because it's not supported by the OSV format.

* `=` for “equal to this version”.
* `<=` for “less than or equal to this version”.
* `<` for “less than this version”.

### Specifying affected versions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

It is important to clearly define the affected versions for an advisory. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provides several options in the **Affected versions** field for you to specify vulnerable version ranges.

For examples showing how affected versions are defined in some existing advisories, see [Examples](#examples).

* A valid affected version string consists of one of the following:
  * A lower bound operator sequence.
  * An upper bound operator sequence.
  * Both an upper and lower bound operator sequence. The lower bound must come first, followed by a comma and a single space, then the upper bound.
  * A specific version sequence using the equality (`=`) operator.
  * Each operator sequence must be specified as the operator, a single space, and then the version. For more information about valid operators, see [Supported operators](#supported-operators) above.
  * The version must begin with a number followed by any number of numbers, letters, dots, dashes, or underscores (anything other than a space or comma). For more information about version formatting, see [Version syntax](#version-syntax) above.

   {% note %}

   **Note:** Affected version strings cannot contain leading or trailing spaces.

   {% endnote %}

* Upper-bound operators can be inclusive or exclusive, i.e. `<=` or `<`, respectively.
* Lower-bound operators can be inclusive or exclusive, i.e. `>=` or `>`, respectively. However, if you publish your repository advisory, and we graduate your repository advisory into a global advisory, a different rule applies: lower-bound strings can only be inclusive, i.e. `>=`. The exclusive lower bound operator (`>`) is only allowed when the version is `0`, for example `> 0`.
* Proper use of spaces
   * Use a space between an operator and a version number.
   * Do not use a space in `>=` or `<=`.
   * Do not use a space between a number and a comma in `>= lower bound, <= upper bound`.
   * Use a space between a comma and the upper bound operator.

  {% note %}

  **Notes:** The lower-bound limitation:
  * Is due to incompatibilities with the OSV schema.
  * Only applies when you make a suggestion on an existing advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}.

  {% endnote %}

* You cannot specify multiple affected version ranges in the same field, such as `> 2.0, < 2.3, > 3.0, < 3.2`.To specify more than one range, you must create a new **Affected products** section for each range, by clicking the **+ Add another affected product** button.

  ![Screenshot of the "Affected products" area of the security advisory form. A link, labeled "Add another affected product", is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/security-advisory-add-another-affected-product.png)
* If the affected version range includes only a single upper or lower bound:
  * The implicit value is always `> 0` if the lower bound is not explicitly specified.
  * The implicit value is always infinity if the upper bound is not explicitly specified.

### Setting an upper bound only on a VVR

* If you set only an upper bound, use `<=` or `<`.
* The {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} uses the PyPA database as one of its data sources. However, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} doesn't match the PyPA VVR format exactly (PyPa security advisories often use `>= 0, <= n` or `>= 0, < n` to refer to version ranges that only have an upper bound).
* There is no need to include `>= 0` in a range that only has an upper bound.

### Setting a lower bound only on a VVR

* The advisory curation team doesn't recommend setting lower bounds only on any advisory other than malware.
This is because, if a fixed version is ever released, users of the fixed version will continue to receive unnecessary {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} until the advisory is manually updated.
* Use `>= 0` for all versions
* `> 0` is generally not used.

### Specifying only one affected version

* `= n` for the single affected version
* Keep in mind that the `=` will not automatically include any public or private previews, _only_ the version specified.

### Common errors

* Avoid using the `< n` vulnerable version range and then saying `n+1` is patched.
   * `< n` should only be used when `n` is not vulnerable.
   * In this case, the VVR should be `<= n` or `< n+1`.

* Avoid using only a number when describing fixed versions with official version numbers that have letters. Say your software has two branches, `linux` and `windows`. When you release `2.0.0-linux` and `2.0.0-windows`, using `< 2.0.0` as the vulnerable version will mark `2.0.0-linux` and `2.0.0-windows` as vulnerable because the version logic interprets `-linux` and `-windows` as prereleases. You will need to mark `2.0.0-linux`, the earliest branch in the alphabet, as the first patched version to avoid `2.0.0-linux` and `2.0.0-windows` being considered vulnerable.

### Examples

#### Advisory with multiple VVRs and multiple operators

[Etcd Gateway TLS authentication only applies to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records (GHSA-wr2v-9rpq-c35q)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr2v-9rpq-c35q) has two vulnerable version ranges:
* `< 3.3.23`, which has an upper bound with no lower bound and uses the `<` operator.
* `>= 3.4.0-rc.0, <= 3.4.9`, which has both an upper bound and a lower bound, and uses the `>=` and `<=` operators.

#### Advisory showing the relationship between a prerelease and a regular release

[XWiki Platform allows XSS through XClass name in string properties (GHSA-wcg9-pgqv-xm5v)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wcg9-pgqv-xm5v) has four vulnerable version ranges:

* `>= 1.1.2, < 14.10.21`
* `>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.5`
* `>= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.10.6`
* `= 16.0.0-rc-1`

Three of these VVRs include prereleases in the range of vulnerable versions. The last VVR, `= 16.0.0-rc-1`, shows that only `16.0.0-rc-1` is vulnerable, while the regular release that came after it, `16.0.0`, isn't. The logic considers `16.0.0-rc-1` and `16.0.0` as separate versions, with `16.0.0-rc-1` being an earlier release than `16.0.0`.

The patch for this vulnerability was published on Jan 24, 2024, for version 16.0.0. For more information see [commit 27eca84](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/27eca8423fc1ad177518077a733076821268509c) in the `xwiki/xwiki-platform ` repository. The [XWiki Platform Old Core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xwiki.platform/xwiki-platform-oldcore) page in the MVN Repository site shows that `16.0.0-rc-1` was published on Jan 22, 2024, before the fix was added to XWiki, and `16.0.0` was published on Jan 29, 2024, after the fix was committed.

#### Advisory with branch names in version numbers

[Google Guava](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava) has two branches, `android` and `jre`, in its version releases. [Guava vulnerable to insecure use of temporary directory (GHSA-7g45-4rm6-3mm3)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7g45-4rm6-3mm3) and [Information Disclosure in Guava (GHSA-5mg8-w23w-74h3)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mg8-w23w-74h3) are advisories about vulnerabilities that affect Guava. Both advisories set `32.0.0-android` as the patched version.

* The version range logic interprets letters after `32.0.0` as prereleases, so if you set the patched version to `32.0.0`, then both `32.0.0-android` and `32.0.0-jre` would be incorrectly marked as vulnerable.
* The version range logic interprets letters later in the alphabet as being a later version than letters earlier in the alphabet, so if you set the patched version to `32.0.0-jre`, then `32.0.0-android` would be incorrectly marked as vulnerable.

The best way to indicate that both `32.0.0-android` and `32.0.0-jre` are patched is to use `32.0.0-android` as the patched version, and the logic will interpret everything after `32.0.0-android` in the alphabet as patched.

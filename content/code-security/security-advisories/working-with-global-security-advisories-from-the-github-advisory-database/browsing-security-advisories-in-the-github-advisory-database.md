## Accessing an advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

You can access any advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/advisories.
1. Optionally, to filter the list of advisories, use the search field or the drop-down menus at the top of the list.

   {% note %}

   **Note:** You can use the sidebar on the left to explore {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed and unreviewed advisories separately, or to filter by ecosystem.

   {% endnote %}

1. Click an advisory to view details. By default, you will see {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed advisories for security vulnerabilities. To show malware advisories, use `type:malware` in the search bar.

The database is also accessible using the GraphQL API. By default, queries will return {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed advisories for security vulnerabilities unless you specify `type:malware`. For more information, see the "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#security_advisory)."

{% ifversion security-advisories-rest-api %}
Additionally, you can access the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} using the REST API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories)."{% endif %}

## Editing an advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

You can suggest improvements to any advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)."

## Searching the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

You can search the database, and use qualifiers to narrow your search. For example, you can search for advisories created on a certain date, in a specific ecosystem, or in a particular library.

{% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

A `GHSA-ID` qualifier is a unique ID that we at {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically assign to every advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. For more information about these identifiers, see "[About the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-the-github-advisory-database#about-ghsa-ids)."

## Viewing your vulnerable repositories

For any {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}, you can see which of your repositories are affected by that security vulnerability or malware. To see a vulnerable repository, you must have access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for that repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts#access-to-dependabot-alerts)."

1. Navigate to https://github.com/advisories.
1. Click an advisory.
1. At the top of the advisory page, click **Dependabot alerts**.
   ![Screenshot of a "global security advisory". The "Dependabot alerts" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/advisory-database-dependabot-alerts.png)
1. Optionally, to filter the list, use the search bar or the drop-down menus. The "Organization" drop-down menu allows you to filter the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} per owner (organization or user).
1. For more details about the advisory, and for advice on how to fix the vulnerable repository, click the repository name.

{% ifversion security-advisories-ghes %}

## Accessing the local advisory database on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}

If your site administrator has enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %} for your instance, you can also browse reviewed advisories locally. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/about-github-connect)".

You can use your local advisory database to check whether a specific security vulnerability is included, and therefore whether you'd get alerts for vulnerable dependencies. You can also view any vulnerable repositories.

1. Navigate to `https://HOSTNAME/advisories`.
1. Optionally, to filter the list, use any of the drop-down menus.
   {% note %}

   **Note:** Only reviewed advisories will be listed. Unreviewed advisories can be viewed in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. For more information, see "[Accessing an advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database](#accessing-an-advisory-in-the-github-advisory-database)".

   {% endnote %}
1. Click an advisory to view details. By default, you will see {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed advisories for security vulnerabilities. To show malware advisories, use `type:malware` in the search bar.

You can also suggest improvements to any advisory directly from your local advisory database. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#editing-advisories-from-your-github-enterprise-server-instance)".

### Viewing vulnerable repositories for your instance

{% data reusables.repositories.enable-security-alerts %}

In the local advisory database, you can see which repositories are affected by each security vulnerability or malware. To see a vulnerable repository, you must have access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for that repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts#access-to-dependabot-alerts)."

1. Navigate to `https://HOSTNAME/advisories`.
1. Click an advisory.
1. At the top of the advisory page, click **Dependabot alerts**.
   ![Screenshot of a "global security advisory". The "Dependabot alerts" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/security/advisory-database-dependabot-alerts.png)
1. Optionally, to filter the list, use the search bar or the drop-down menus. The "Organization" drop-down menu allows you to filter the {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} per owner (organization or user).
1. For more details about the advisory, and for advice on how to fix the vulnerable repository, click the repository name.

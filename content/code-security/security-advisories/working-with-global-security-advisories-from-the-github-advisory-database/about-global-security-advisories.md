## About global security advisories

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}There are two types of advisories: global security advisories and repository security advisories. For more information about repository security advisories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)."{% endif %}

Global security advisories are grouped into these categories: {% data variables.product.company_short %}-reviewed advisories, unreviewed advisories, and malware advisories.
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.github-reviewed-overview %}
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.unreviewed-overview %}
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.malware-overview %}

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} doesn't generate {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for unreviewed and malware advisories.

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.security-advisory.global-advisories %}

Every repository advisory is reviewed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_security %} curation team for consideration as a global advisory. We publish security advisories for any of the ecosystems supported by the dependency graph to the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} on [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories).

You can access any advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}.

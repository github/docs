## Editing advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

The advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} are global security advisories. For more information about global security advisories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-global-security-advisories)."

Anyone can suggest improvements on any global security advisory in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}. You can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted. The {% data variables.product.prodname_security %} curation team will review the submitted improvements and publish them onto the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} if accepted.

{% ifversion security-advisories-credit-types %}
If we accept and publish the improvement, the person who submitted the improvement will automatically be assigned a credit type of  "Analyst".

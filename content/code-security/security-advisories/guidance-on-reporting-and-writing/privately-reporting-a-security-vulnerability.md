**Note:** If you have admin or security permissions for a public repository, you don't need to submit a vulnerability report. Instead, you can create a draft security advisory directly. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory)."

## About privately reporting a security vulnerability

Security researchers often feel responsible for alerting users to a vulnerability that could be exploited. If there are no clear instructions about contacting maintainers of the repository containing the vulnerability, security researchers may have no other choice but to post about the vulnerability on social media, send direct messages to the maintainer, or even create public issues. This situation can potentially lead to a public disclosure of the vulnerability details.

Private vulnerability reporting makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to repository maintainer using a simple form. 

For security researchers, the benefits of using private vulnerability reporting are: 
- Less frustration, and less time spent trying to figure out how to contact the maintainer.
- A smoother process for disclosing and discussing vulnerability details.
- The opportunity to discuss vulnerability details privately with repository maintainer.

## Privately reporting a security vulnerability

If you do not have admin or security permissions for a public repository, you can still privately report a security vulnerability to repository maintainers. You can also evaluate the general security of a public repository and suggest a security policy. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/evaluating-the-security-settings-of-a-repository)."

The next steps depend on the action taken by the repository maintainer. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/managing-privately-reported-security-vulnerabilities)."

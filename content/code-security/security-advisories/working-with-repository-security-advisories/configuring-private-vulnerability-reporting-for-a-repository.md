## About privately reporting a security vulnerability

Security researchers often feel responsible for alerting users to a vulnerability that could be exploited. If there are no clear instructions about contacting maintainers of the repository containing the vulnerability, security researchers may have no other choice but to post about the vulnerability on social media, send direct messages to the maintainer, or even create public issues. This situation can potentially lead to a public disclosure of the vulnerability details.

- You are watching the repository.
- You have enabled notifications for "All Activity".
- In your notification settings, under "Subscriptions", then under "Watching", you have selected to receive notifications by email.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. To start watching the repository, select **{% octicon "eye" aria-hidden="true" %} Watch**.

   ![Screenshot of the repository's main page. A dropdown menu, titled "Watch", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/repository-watch-dropdown.png)

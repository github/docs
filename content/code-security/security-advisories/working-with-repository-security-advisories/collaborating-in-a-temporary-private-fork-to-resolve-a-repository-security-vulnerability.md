{% data reusables.security-advisory.repository-level-advisory-note %}

## Prerequisites

Before you can collaborate in a temporary private fork, you must create a draft security advisory. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory)."

## Creating a temporary private fork

Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can create a temporary private fork.

To keep information about vulnerabilities secure, integrations, including CI, cannot access temporary private forks.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-advisories %}
1. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory you'd like to create a temporary private fork in.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the advisory form and click **Start a temporary private fork**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Collaborate on a patch in private" area of the form. A button, labeled "Start a temporary private fork", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/new-temporary-private-fork-button.png)

   A private fork of the repository is created and shown on the advisory page.

   The naming convention for the private fork is very similar to the convention used for advisories in the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} and follows this format: `repo-ghsa-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`, where:
    * `repo` is the name of the repository. To stay under the 100 character limit on repository names, we truncate the original repository's name to 80 characters.
    * `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` is the unique identifier of the draft security advisory:
       * `x` is a letter or a number from the following set: `23456789cfghjmpqrvwx`.
       * The numbers and letters are randomly assigned.
       * All letters and numbers are lowercase.

For example, if you create a temporary private fork in a repository called `octocat-repo`, and the automatically generated ID for the draft advisory is `GHSA-x854-cvjg-vx26`, the temporary fork will be called `octocat-repo-ghsa-x854-cvjg-vx26`.

You can also use the REST API to create temporary private forks. For more information, see "[Create a temporary private fork](/rest/security-advisories/repository-advisories#create-a-temporary-private-fork)" in the REST API documentation.

## Adding collaborators to a temporary private fork

Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can add additional collaborators to the security advisory, and collaborators on the security advisory can access the temporary private fork. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/adding-a-collaborator-to-a-repository-security-advisory)."

## Adding changes to a temporary private fork

Anyone with write permissions to a security advisory can collaborate on a patch by committing changes to a temporary private fork.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-advisories %}
1. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory you'd like to work on.
1. You can make your changes on {% data variables.product.product_name %} or locally:
   * To make your changes on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, under "Collaborate on a patch", click **the temporary private fork**. Then, create a new branch and edit files. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)."
   * To add changes locally, follow the instructions under "Clone and create a new branch" and "Make your changes, then push."

## Creating a pull request from a temporary private fork

Anyone with write permissions to a security advisory can create a pull request from a temporary private fork.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-advisories %}
1. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory you'd like to create a pull request in.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the advisory form. Then, under "Collaborate on a patch", click **Compare & pull request** to create a pull request for the associated branch.

   ![Screenshot of the "Collaborate on a patch" area of a draft security advisory. The "Compare & pull request" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/security-advisory-compare-and-pr.png)
   The "Open a pull request" includes a header showing the branches that will be compared in a three-dot Git diff comparison when the pull request is created. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests#three-dot-and-two-dot-git-diff-comparisons)."
{% data reusables.repositories.create-pull-request %}

{% data reusables.repositories.merge-all-pulls-together %} For more information, see "[Merging changes in a security advisory](#merging-changes-in-a-security-advisory)."

## Merging changes in a security advisory

Anyone with admin permissions to a security advisory can merge changes in a security advisory.

{% data reusables.repositories.merge-all-pulls-together %}

Before you can merge changes in a security advisory, every open pull request in the temporary private fork must be mergeable. To keep information about vulnerabilities secure, status checks do not run on pull requests in temporary private forks. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)."

Additionally, there can be no merge conflicts, and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} won't enforce any of the protection rules that you may have set up for the branch you're trying to merge the changes in to.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-security %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-advisories %}
1. In the "Security Advisories" list, click the name of the security advisory with changes that you'd like to merge.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the advisory form. Then, under "This advisory is ready to be merged", click **Merge pull request(s)** to merge all open pull requests in the temporary private fork.

   ![Screenshot of the "Collaborate on a patch" area of a draft security advisory. The "Merge pull requests" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/merge-pull-requests-button.png)

  {% note %}

  **Note:** You can only merge one pull request into the `main` branch of a temporary private fork. If more than one pull request targets the `main` branch, merging is blocked.

  {% endnote %}

After you merge changes in a security advisory, you can publish the security advisory to alert your community about the security vulnerability in previous versions of your project. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory)."

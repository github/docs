## About push protection from the REST API

Push protection prevents you from accidentally committing secrets to a repository by blocking pushes containing supported secrets.

The "Create a blob" and "Create or update file contents" endpoints in the REST API include push protection. See "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/git/blobs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-blob)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-or-update-file-contents)."

If you make a request with these endpoints whose content includes a supported secret, the REST API will return a 409 error, indicating that a secret has been detected.

To resolve the error, you can either:

* **Remove** the secret from the content of your API request before trying again.
* **Create a push protection bypass**: You can bypass push protection using the "Create a push protection bypass" endpoint. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/secret-scanning/secret-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-push-protection-bypass)."

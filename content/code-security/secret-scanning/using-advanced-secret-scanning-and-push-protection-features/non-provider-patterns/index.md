intro: '{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} can also alert you to the potential use of other types of secret in code, for example: HTTP authentication headers, connection strings, and private keys. These non-provider patterns are more difficult to detect reliably so this feature is not enabled by default.'

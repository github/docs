## Configuring delegated dismissal for a repository

>[!NOTE] If an organization owner configures delegated alert dismissal via an enforced security configuration, the settings can't be changed at the repository level.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}
1. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_protection %}", to the right of "Prevent direct alert dismissals", click **Enable**.

## Configuring delegated dismissal for an organization

You must configure delegated dismissal for your organization using a custom security configuration. You can then apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization.

1. Create a new custom security configuration, or edit an existing one. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/creating-a-custom-security-configuration#creating-a-custom-security-configuration).
1. When defining the custom security configuration, under "{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %}", ensure that the dropdown menu for "Prevent direct alert dismissals" is set to **Enabled**.
1. Click **Save configuration**.
1. Apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-a-custom-security-configuration).

To learn more about security configurations, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/introduction-to-securing-your-organization-at-scale/about-enabling-security-features-at-scale).

>[!NOTE]
> You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} with fine-grained permissions to programmatically review and approve delegated dismissal requests. This enables your organization to streamline security request reviews and enforce policies, or integrate with external security tools, ensuring that all reviews meet established standards. _For {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, the use of {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} to review requests for delegated dismissals is available from version 3.19._

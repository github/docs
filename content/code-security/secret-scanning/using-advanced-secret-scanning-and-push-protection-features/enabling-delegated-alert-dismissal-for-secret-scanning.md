>[!NOTE] If an organization owner configures delegated alert dismissal via an enforced security configuration, the settings can't be changed at the repository level.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}

## Configuring delegated dismissal for an organization

You must configure delegated dismissal for your organization using a custom security configuration. You can then apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization.

1. Create a new custom security configuration, or edit an existing one. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/creating-a-custom-security-configuration#creating-a-custom-security-configuration).
1. When creating the custom security configuration, under "{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %}", ensure that the dropdown menus for "Alerts" and "Prevent direct alert dismissals" are set to **Enabled**.
1. Click **Save configuration**.
1. Apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-a-custom-security-configuration).

## About security tools for auditors

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provides tools for security auditors and developers to review and analyze responses to security alerts within an enterprise or organization. This guide describes the tools, which include historical timelines, security overview, audit logs, the API, and webhooks.

Security auditors can use these tools to ensure the appropriate actions are being taken to resolve security alerts and to identify areas for additional training. Developers can use these tools to monitor and debug their own security alerts. You will only see data for repositories and organizations to which you already have access.

## Security alert timelines

Each security alert has a historical timeline that shows when the alert was created or when a problem was detected. When the status of an alert changes this is recorded on the timeline, regardless of what caused the change, for example, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} closing a fixed alert and a developer reopening an alert. You can see the historical timeline for an alert on the alert page under the description of the problem.

Many of the events in the timeline also create an event in the audit log, which you can query using the audit log UI or the API. For more information, see "[Audit log](/code-security/getting-started/auditing-security-alerts#audit-log)."

## Security overview page

Security overview consolidates information about security alerts and provides high-level summaries of the security status of your enterprise or organization.

In security overview you can see repositories with open security alerts{% ifversion security-overview-org-risk-coverage %}, as well as which repositories have enabled specific security features{% endif %}. You can also use security overview to filter and sort security alerts using interactive views.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview)."

## Audit log

You can access and search audit logs using the API or the audit log UI. The audit log lists events that are triggered by activities affecting your enterprise or organization, including events that are created when there are certain interactions with a security alert. Interactions that create an event can be triggered manually or by automation, for example, when {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} creates an alert.

* {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} events track when an alert is created, resolved, or reopened, also when push protection is bypassed.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} events track when an alert is created, dismissed, or resolved.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} does not create timeline events in an audit log.

For a list of audit log events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/audit-log-events-for-your-organization)."

For information on how to access the audit log for your enterprise or organization, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

{% ifversion audit-log-streaming %}

You can also stream audit data from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to an external data management system, which enables you to analyze and collect data for internal charts. Enterprise owners can configure audit log streaming. For more information, see "[Streaming the audit log for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)."

{% endif %}

## Webhooks

You can set up `code_scanning_alert`, `dependabot_alert`, and `secret_scanning_alert` webhooks to receive payloads whenever there is a response to a security alert in an organization or repository. You can also define which responses to act on, for example, you might want to define a webhook that tracks {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} alerts created when someone bypasses push protection using the alert property `"push_protection_bypassed": true`.

You can also integrate webhook payloads into other tools you use to monitor and inform security behaviors. For example, a webhook fires when a secret alert is either created, resolved, {% ifversion secret-scanning-validity-check-partner-patterns %}revoked, reopened, or when a secret's validity status changes{% else %}or reopened{% endif %}. You can then parse the webhook payload and integrate it into tools your team uses like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Splunk, or email. For more information, see "[About webhooks](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks)" and "[Webhook events and payloads](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)."

## API

You can use the API to list and interact with security alerts, for example, getting the most recent information about updates or dismissals of an alert. You can also use the API to make additional updates to the alert or to automate follow-up actions, such as creating a new issue for each alert that needs further action. Only the current status of an alert is reported by the API.

### {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alerts API

You can list all {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alerts for a repository, organization, or enterprise, or use path parameters to list only alerts that meet a specific set of criteria. For example, you might only want to list {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alerts for Maven that were dismissed. Alternatively, you can get full details for an alert or update the alert.

For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} alerts](/rest/dependabot/alerts#about-dependabot-alerts)."

### {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} alerts API

You can list all {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} alerts for a repository, organization, or enterprise, or use path parameters to list only alerts that meet a specific set of criteria. Alternatively, you can get full details for an alert or update the alert.

To see which {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} alerts were the result of a push protection bypass, filter the results for `"push_protection_bypassed": true`.

For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %}](/rest/secret-scanning)."

### {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} alerts API

You can list all {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} alerts for a repository, organization, or enterprise, or use path parameters to list only alerts that meet a specific set of criteria. Alternatively, you can get full details for an alert or update the alert.

For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}](/rest/code-scanning)."

{% endif %}

### Security policy

Make it easy for your users to confidentially report security vulnerabilities they've found in your repository. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository).

### Dependency graph

The dependency graph allows you to explore the ecosystems and packages that your repository depends on and the repositories and packages that depend on your repository.

You can find the dependency graph on the **Insights** tab for your repository. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

You can export the dependency graph of your repository as an SPDX-compatible, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository).

### {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %} contains a curated list of security vulnerabilities that you can view, search, and filter. {% data reusables.security-advisory.link-browsing-advisory-db %}

### {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} and security updates

View alerts about dependencies that are known to contain security vulnerabilities, and choose whether to have pull requests generated automatically to update these dependencies. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)
and [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).

You can also use default {% data variables.dependabot.auto_triage_rules %} curated by {% data variables.product.github %} to automatically filter out a substantial amount of false positives.

{% data reusables.dependabot.quickstart-link %}

### {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_version_updates %}

Use {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} to automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date. This helps reduce your exposure to older versions of dependencies. Using newer versions makes it easier to apply patches if security vulnerabilities are discovered, and also makes it easier for {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} to successfully raise pull requests to upgrade vulnerable dependencies. You can also customize {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_version_updates %} to streamline their integration into your repositories. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates).

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

### Security advisories

Privately discuss and fix security vulnerabilities in your public repository's code. You can then publish a security advisory to alert your community to the vulnerability and encourage community members to upgrade. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).

{% endif %}

### Repository rulesets

Enforce consistent code standards, security, and compliance across branches and tags. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

### Artifact attestations

Create unfalsifiable provenance and integrity guarantees for the software you build. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).

{% ifversion fpt %}

> [!NOTE]
> If you are on a {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}, or {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} plan, artifact attestations are only available for public repositories. To use artifact attestations in private or internal repositories, you must be on a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} plan.{% endif %}

### {% data variables.secret-scanning.partner_alerts_caps %}

When {% data variables.product.github %} detects a leaked secret in a public repository, or a public npm packages, {% data variables.product.github %} informs the relevant service provider that the secret may be compromised. For details of the supported secrets and service providers, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets).

{% ifversion secret-scanning-push-protection-for-users %}

### Push protection for users

Push protection for users automatically protects you from accidentally committing secrets to public repositories, regardless of whether the repository itself has {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} enabled. Push protection for users is on by default, but you can disable the feature at any time through your personal account settings. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection/push-protection-for-users).

{% endif %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghas-products %}

## Available with {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_secret_protection %}

For accounts on {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.prodname_team %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}{% endif %}{% ifversion ghes %} {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}{% endif %}, you can access additional security features when you purchase **{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_secret_protection %}**.  

{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_secret_protection %} includes features that help you detect and prevent secret leaks, such as {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} and push protection.

These features are available for all repository types. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Some of these features are available for public repositories free of charge, meaning that you don't need to purchase {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_secret_protection %} to enable the feature on a public repository.{% endif %}

<!--Hiding information on setting up a trial for now, as there is no available link for fpt yet. Needs versioning for fpt, ghec and ghes.
For information about how you can try {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_secret_protection %} for free, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-advanced-security).
-->

{% else %}

## Available with {% data variables.product.prodname_GHAS %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_GHAS %} features are available for enterprises with a license for {% data variables.product.prodname_GHAS %}. The features are restricted to repositories owned by an organization.

{% endif %}

### {% data variables.secret-scanning.user_alerts_caps %}

Automatically detect tokens or credentials that have been checked into a repository. You can view alerts for any secrets that {% data variables.product.github %} finds in your code, in the **Security** tab of the repository, so that you know which tokens or credentials to treat as compromised. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning/about-alerts#about-user-alerts).

{% data reusables.advanced-security.available-for-public-repos %}

{% ifversion secret-scanning-ai-generic-secret-detection %}

### {% data variables.secret-scanning.copilot-secret-scanning %}

{% data variables.secret-scanning.copilot-secret-scanning %}'s generic secret detection is an AI-powered expansion of {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} that identifies unstructured secrets (passwords) in your source code and then generates an alert. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/copilot-secret-scanning/responsible-ai-generic-secrets).

{% endif %}

### Push protection

Push protection proactively scans your code, and any repository contributors' code, for secrets during the push process and blocks the push if any secrets are detected. If a contributor bypasses the block, {% data variables.product.github %} creates an alert. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-push-protection).

{% data reusables.advanced-security.available-for-public-repos %}

{% ifversion push-protection-delegated-bypass %}

### Delegated bypass for push protection

Delegated bypass for push protection lets you control which individuals, roles and teams can bypass push protection, and implements a review and approval cycle for pushes containing secrets. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/delegated-bypass-for-push-protection/about-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection).

{% endif %}

### Custom patterns

You can define custom patterns to identify secrets that are not detected by the default patterns supported by {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}, such as patterns that are internal to your organization. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/custom-patterns/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning).

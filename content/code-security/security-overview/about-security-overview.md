{% ifversion fpt %}{% data reusables.security-overview.about-security-overview %} For more information, see [the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview).{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}

Security overview contains focused views where you can explore trends in detection, remediation, and prevention of security alerts and dig deep into the current state of your codebases.

* Information about {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} features and alerts is shown for all repositories.
* Information for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} features, such as {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %}, is shown for enterprises that use {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}{% ifversion ghec %} and for public repositories{% endif %}.

For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts#dependabot-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) and [AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security).

## About the views

> [!NOTE]
> All views show information and metrics for the **default** branches of the repositories you have permission to view in an organization or enterprise.

The views are interactive with filters that allow you to look at the aggregated data in detail and identify sources of high risk, see security trends, and see the impact of pull request analysis on blocking security vulnerabilities entering your code. As you apply multiple filters to focus on narrower areas of interest, all data and metrics across the view change to reflect your current selection. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/filtering-alerts-in-security-overview).

{% ifversion security-overview-export-data %}
{% data reusables.security-overview.download-csv-files %} For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/exporting-data-from-security-overview).
{% endif %}

There are dedicated views for each type of security alert. You can limit your analysis to a specific type of alert, and then narrow the results further with a range of filters specific to each view. For example, in the {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} alert view, you can use the "Secret type" filter to view only {% data variables.secret-scanning.alerts %} for a specific secret, like a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}.

> [!NOTE]
> Security overview displays active alerts raised by security features. If there are no alerts shown in security overview for a repository, undetected security vulnerabilities or code errors may still exist or the feature may not be enabled for that repository.

## About security overview for organizations

The application security team at your company can use the different views for both broad and specific analyses of your organization's security status. For example, {% ifversion security-overview-dashboard %}the team can use the "Overview" dashboard view to track your organization's security landscape and progression{% else %}the team can use the "Coverage" view to monitor the adoption of features across your organization or by a specific team as you roll out {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, or use the "Risk" view to identify repositories with more than five open {% data variables.secret-scanning.alerts %}{% endif %}. {% ifversion pre-security-configurations %}You can also use security overview to find a set of repositories and enable or disable security features for them all at the same time. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/enabling-security-features-for-multiple-repositories).{% endif %}

You can find security overview on the **Security** tab for any organization. Each view shows a summary of the data that you have access to. As you add filters, all data and metrics across the view change to reflect the repositories or alerts that you've selected. For information about permissions, see [Permission to view data in security overview](#permission-to-view-data-in-security-overview).

Security overview has multiple views that provide different ways to explore enablement and alert data.

{% ifversion security-overview-dashboard %}
* **Overview:** visualize trends in **Detection**, **Remediation**, and **Prevention** of security alerts, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights).{% endif %}
* **Risk and Alert views:** explore the risk from security alerts of all types or focus on a single alert type and identify your risk from specific vulnerable dependencies, code weaknesses, or leaked secrets, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/assessing-code-security-risk).
* **Coverage:** assess the adoption of code security features across repositories in the organization, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/assessing-adoption-code-security).{% ifversion security-overview-tool-adoption %}
* **Enablement trends:** see how quickly different teams are adopting security features.{% endif %}{% ifversion security-overview-org-codeql-pr-alerts %}
* **CodeQL pull request alerts:** assess the impact of running CodeQL on pull requests and how development teams are resolving code scanning alerts, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-metrics-for-pull-request-alerts).{% endif %}{% ifversion security-overview-push-protection-metrics-page %}
* **Secret scanning:** find out which types of secret are blocked by push protection{% ifversion security-overview-delegated-bypass-requests %} and which teams are bypassing push protection{% endif %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/viewing-metrics-for-secret-scanning-push-protection){% ifversion security-overview-delegated-bypass-requests %} and [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-overview/reviewing-requests-to-bypass-push-protection){% endif %}.{% endif %}

{% ifversion security-campaigns %}
You also create and manage security campaigns to remediate alerts from security overview, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/fixing-security-alerts-at-scale/creating-tracking-security-campaigns) and [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/fixing-security-alerts-at-scale/best-practice-fix-alerts-at-scale).
{% endif %}

## About security overview for enterprises

You can find security overview on the **Code Security** tab for your enterprise. Each page displays aggregated and repository-specific security information for your enterprise.

As with security overview for organizations, security overview for enterprises has multiple views that provide different ways to explore data.

For information about permissions, see [Permission to view data in security overview](#permission-to-view-data-in-security-overview).

## Permission to view data in security overview

### Organization-level overview

If you are an **owner or security manager** for an organization, you can see data for all the repositories in the organization in all views.

If you are an **organization or team member**, you can view security overview for the organization and see data for repositories where you have an appropriate level of access.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure a consistent and responsive experience, for organization members, the organization-level security overview pages will only display results from the most recently updated 3,000 repositories. If your results have been restricted, a notification will appear at the top of the page. Organization owners and security managers will see results from all repositories.

For more information about access to security alerts and related views, see [AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#granting-access-to-security-alerts) and [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/about-custom-repository-roles#security).

### Enterprise-level overview

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an **enterprise owner**, you will need to join an organization as an organization owner to view data for the organization's repositories in both the organization-level and enterprise-level overview.{% ifversion secret-scanning-user-owned-repos %} {% data reusables.secret-scanning.secret-scanning-user-owned-repo-access %}{% endif %} For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise).

In the enterprise-level security overview, you can see data for all organizations where you are an **organization owner or security manager**. {% ifversion pre-security-configurations %}However, you cannot use the enterprise-level security overview to enable and disable security features. {% endif %}For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/managing-github-advanced-security-features-for-your-enterprise).

{% ifversion ghec %}
If you're an owner of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, you can view data from user-owned repositories in security overview and filter by repository owner type. For more information on {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users).

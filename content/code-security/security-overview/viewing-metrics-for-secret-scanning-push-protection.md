## About metrics for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} push protection

The metrics overview for {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} push protection helps you to understand how well you are preventing security leaks in your organization{% ifversion security-overview-enterprise-secret-scanning-metrics %} or across organizations in your enterprise{% endif %}. You can use the metrics to assess how push protection is performing, and to easily identify the repositories where you may need to take action in order to prevent leaks of sensitive information.

The overview shows you a summary of how many pushes containing secrets have been successfully blocked by push protection, as well as how many times push protection was bypassed.

You can also find more granular metrics, such as:
* The secret types that have been blocked or bypassed the most
* The repositories that have had the most pushes blocked
* The repositories that are bypassing push protection the most
* The percentage distribution of reasons that users give when they bypass the protection

## About {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pull request alerts metrics for an organization

The metrics overview for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pull request alerts helps you to understand how well {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} is preventing vulnerabilities in your organization. You can use the metrics to assess how {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} is performing in pull requests, and to easily identify the repositories where you may need to take action in order to identify and reduce security risks.

The overview shows you a summary of how many vulnerabilities prevented by {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} have been caught in pull requests. The metrics are only tracked for pull requests that have been merged into the default branches of repositories in your organization.

You can also find more granular metrics, such as how many alerts were fixed with and without {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix_short %} suggestions, how many were unresolved and merged, and how many were dismissed as false positive or as risk accepted.

You can also view:

* The rules that are causing the most alerts in your organization, and how many alerts each rule is associated with.

* The number of alerts that were fixed with an accepted {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix_short %} suggestion, displayed as a fraction of how many total {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix_short %} suggestions were available.

* Remediation rates, in a graph showing the percentage of alerts that were remediated with an available {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix_short %} suggestion, and the percentage of alerts that were remediated without a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_autofix_short %} suggestion.

You can apply filters to the data. The metrics are based on activity from the default period or your selected period.

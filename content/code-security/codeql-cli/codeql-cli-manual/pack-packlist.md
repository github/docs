## Synopsis

```shell copy
codeql pack packlist <options>... -- <dir>
```

## Description

\[Plumbing] Compute the set of files to be included in a QL query pack
or library pack.

This command determines the set of files to be included in the pack
based on the patterns specified in any `.gitignore` files present in the
pack or in an ancestor directory.

Available since `v2.6.0`.

## Options

### Primary Options

#### `<dir>`

The root directory of the package.

#### `--format=<fmt>`

Select output format, either `text` _(default)_ or `json`.

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)

#### `--common-caches=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Controls the location of cached data on disk that will
persist between several runs of the CLI, such as downloaded QL packs and
compiled query plans. If not set explicitly, this defaults to a
directory named `.codeql` in the user's home directory; it will be
created if it doesn't already exist.

Available since `v2.15.2`.

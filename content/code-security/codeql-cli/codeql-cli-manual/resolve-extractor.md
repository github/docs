## Synopsis

```shell copy
codeql resolve extractor --language=<lang> <options>...
```

## Description

\[Deep plumbing] Determine the extractor pack to use for a given
language.

## Options

### Primary Options

#### `-l, --language=<lang>`

\[Mandatory] The name of the extractor to locate.

#### `--search-path=<dir>[:<dir>...]`

A list of directories under which extractor packs may be found. The
directories can either be the extractor packs themselves or directories
that contain extractors as immediate subdirectories.

If the path contains multiple directory trees, their order defines
precedence between them: if the target language is matched in more than
one of the directory trees, the one given first wins.

The extractors bundled with the CodeQL toolchain itself will always be
found, but if you need to use separately distributed extractors you need
to give this option (or, better yet, set up `--search-path` in a
per-user configuration file).

(Note: On Windows the path separator is `;`).

#### `--just-check`

Don't print any output, but exit with code 0 if the extractor is found,
and code 1 otherwise.

#### `--format=<fmt>`

Select output format. Choices include:

`text` _(default)_: Print the path to the found extractor pack to
standard output.

`json`: Print the path to the found extractor pack as a JSON string.

`betterjson`: Print details about the found extractor pack as a JSON
string.

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)

## Synopsis

```shell copy
codeql github merge-results --sarif=<file> --output=<file> <options>...
```

## Description

\[Deep plumbing] Merges multiple SARIF files into a single SARIF file.

## Options

### Primary Options

#### `-s, --sarif=<file>`

\[Mandatory] Path to the SARIF files to use. This should be the output
of [codeql database analyze](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/database-analyze) (or [codeql database interpret-results](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/database-interpret-results)) with `--format sarif-latest` for upload to github.com or
the appropriate supported format tag for GitHub Enterprise Server
instances (see [AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning) for
SARIF versions supported by your release).

#### `-o, --output=<file>`

\[Mandatory] Path where the merged SARIF file should be stored.

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)

#### `--common-caches=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Controls the location of cached data on disk that will
persist between several runs of the CLI, such as downloaded QL packs and
compiled query plans. If not set explicitly, this defaults to a
directory named `.codeql` in the user's home directory; it will be
created if it doesn't already exist.

Available since `v2.15.2`.

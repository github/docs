## Synopsis

```shell copy
codeql execute query-server <options>...
```

## Description

\[Deprecated] \[Plumbing] Support for running queries from IDEs.

The
[codeql execute query-server](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/execute-query-server) subcommand is unsupported and no longer works. If you are using the official CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, please upgrade the extension to 1.7.6 or a later version. Otherwise please migrate your CodeQL IDE integration to the `codeql execute query-server2` subcommand.

## Options

### Primary Options

### Common options

#### `-h, --help`

Show this help text.

#### `-J=<opt>`

\[Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

(Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

#### `-v, --verbose`

Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

#### `-q, --quiet`

Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

#### `--verbosity=<level>`

\[Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides `-v`
and `-q`.

#### `--logdir=<dir>`

\[Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name of
the running subcommand.

(To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
give `--log-to-stderr` and redirect stderr as desired.)

## About creating {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query suites

{% data reusables.code-scanning.codeql-cli-version-ghes %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query suites provide a way of selecting queries, based on their
filename, location on disk or in a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack, or metadata properties.
Create query suites for the queries that you want to frequently use in
your {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} analyses.

Query suites allow you to pass multiple queries to {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} without having to specify the path to each query file individually. Query suite definitions are stored in YAML files with the extension `.qls`. A suite definition is a sequence of instructions, where each instruction is a YAML
mapping with (usually) a single key. The instructions are executed in the order
they appear in the query suite definition. After all the instructions in the
suite definition have been executed, the result is a set of selected queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Any custom queries that you want to add to a query suite must be in a [{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/customizing-analysis-with-codeql-packs) and contain the correct query metadata. For more information, see [Using custom queries with the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql_cli %}](/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/using-custom-queries-with-the-codeql-cli).

## Locating queries to add to a query suite

When creating a query suite, you first need to specify the locations of the
queries that you want to select. You can define the location of one or more
queries using:

* A `query` instruction: Tells {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} to look for one or more specified `.ql`
files:

  ```yaml
  - query: <path-to-query>
  ```

  The argument must be one or more file paths, relative to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack containing
  the suite definition.

* A `queries` instruction: Tells {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} to recursively scan a directory
for `.ql` files:

  ```yaml
  - queries: <path-to-subdirectory>
  ```

  The path of the directory must be relative to the root of the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack that
  contains the suite definition file. To find the queries relative to a
  different {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack, add a `from` field:

  ```yaml
  - queries: <path-to-subdirectory>
    from: <ql-pack-name>
    version: ^x.y.z
  ```

  The `version` field is optional and specifies a range of compatible versions of this {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack.
  If you don’t specify a version, then the most recent version of the pack is used.

* A `qlpack` instruction: Tells {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} to resolve queries in the default suite of the
named {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack:

  ```yaml
  - qlpack: <qlpack-name>
    version: ^x.y.z
  ```

  The default suite of a query pack includes a recommended set of queries
  inside of that query pack. Not all query packs have a default suite. If the given query pack does not define a default suite, the qlpack instruction will resolve to all of the queries within the pack.

  The `version` field is optional and specifies a range of compatible versions of this {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack.
  If you don’t specify a version, then the most recent version of the pack is used.

> [!NOTE]
> When pathnames appear in query suite definitions, they must always be given with a forward slash, `/`, as a directory separator. This ensures that query suite definitions work on all operating systems.

You must add at least one `query`, `queries`, or `qlpack` instruction to
your suite definition, otherwise no queries will be selected. If the suite
contains no further instructions, all the queries found from the list of files,
in the given directory, or in the named {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack are selected. If there are further
filtering instructions, only queries that match the constraints imposed by those
instructions will be selected.

## Filtering the queries in a query suite

After you have defined the initial set of queries to add to your suite by
specifying `query`, `queries`, or `qlpack` instructions, you can add
`include` and `exclude` instructions. These instructions define selection
criteria based on specific properties:

* When you execute an `include` instruction on a set of queries, any
queries that match your conditions are retained in the selection, and queries
that don’t match are removed.
* When you execute an `exclude` instructions on a set of queries,
any queries that match your conditions are removed from the selection, and queries
that don’t match are retained.

The order of your filter instructions is important. The first filter instruction
that appears after the locating instructions determines whether the queries are
included or excluded by default. If the first filter is an `include`, the
initially located queries will only be part of the suite if they match an
explicit `include` filter. If the first filter is an `exclude`, the initially
located queries are part of the suite unless they are explicitly excluded.

Subsequent instructions are executed in order and the instructions that appear
later in the file take precedence over the earlier instructions. So, `include`
instructions can be overridden by a later `exclude` instructions that match
the same query. Similarly, `exclude`s can be overridden by a later
`include`.

For both instructions, the argument is a constraint block—that is, a YAML map
representing the constraints. Each constraint is a map entry, where the key is
typically a query metadata property. The value can be:

* A single string.
* A `/`-enclosed [regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
* A list containing strings, regular expressions, or both.

To match a constraint, a metadata value must match one of the strings or
regular expressions. When there is more than one metadata key, each key must be matched.
The standard metadata keys available to match on are: `description`, `id`, `kind`,
`name`, `tags`, `precision`, and `problem.severity`.
For more information about query metadata properties, see
[Metadata for {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} queries](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/metadata-for-codeql-queries/#metadata-for-codeql-queries).

In addition to metadata tags, the keys in the constraint block can also be:

* `query filename`: Matches on the last path component of the query file name.
* `query path`: Matches on the path to the query file relative to its
enclosing {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack.
* `tags contain`: One of the given match strings must match
one of the space-separated components of the value of the `@tags` metadata property.
* `tags contain all`: Each of the given match strings must match one of the
components of the `@tags` metadata property.

### Examples of filtering which queries are run

A common use case is to create a query suite that runs all queries in a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack,
except for a few specific queries that the user does not want to run. In general, we
recommend filtering on the query `id`, which is a unique and stable identifier for
each query. The following three query suite definitions are semantically identical and
filter by the query `id`:

This filter matches all the queries in the default suite of `codeql/cpp-queries`, except for the two queries with the excluded identifiers:

```yaml
- qlpack: codeql/cpp-queries
- exclude:
    id:
      - cpp/cleartext-transmission
      - cpp/cleartext-storage-file
```

In this example, a separate `exclude` instruction is used for each query:

```yaml
- qlpack: codeql/cpp-queries
- exclude:
    id: cpp/cleartext-transmission
- exclude:
    id: cpp/cleartext-storage-file
```

In this example, a regular expression excludes the same two queries. It would also exclude any future queries added to the suite with identifiers that begin: `cpp/cleartext-`:

```yaml
- qlpack: codeql/cpp-queries
- exclude:
    id:
      - /^cpp\/cleartext-.*/
```

To define a suite that selects all queries in the default suite of the
`codeql/cpp-queries` {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack, and then refines them to only include
security queries, use:

```yaml
- qlpack: codeql/cpp-queries
- include:
    tags contain: security
```

To define a suite that selects all queries with `@kind problem`
and `@precision high` from the `my-custom-queries` directory, use:

```yaml
- queries: my-custom-queries
- include:
    kind: problem
    precision: very-high
```

Note that the following query suite definition behaves differently from the definition above. This definition selects queries that are `@kind problem` _or_
are `@precision very-high`:

```yaml
- queries: my-custom-queries
- include:
    kind: problem
- include:
    precision: very-high
```

To create a suite that selects all queries with `@kind problem` from the
`my-custom-queries` directory except those with `@problem.severity
recommendation`, use:

```yaml
- queries: my-custom-queries
- include:
    kind: problem
- exclude:
    problem.severity: recommendation
```

To create a suite that selects all queries with `@tag security` and
`@precision high` or `very-high` from the `codeql/cpp-queries` {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack,
use:

```yaml
- queries: .
  from: codeql/cpp-queries
- include:
    tags contain: security
    precision:
    - high
    - very-high
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `codeql resolve queries /path/to/suite.qls` command to see which queries are selected by a query suite definition. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/resolve-queries).

## Reusing existing query suite definitions

Existing query suite definitions can be reused by specifying:

* An `import` instruction: Adds the queries selected by a
previously defined `.qls` file to the current suite:

  ```yaml
  - import: <path-to-query-suite>
  ```

  The path to the imported suite must be relative to the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack containing the
  current suite definition. If the imported query suite is in a different QL
  pack you can use:

  ```yaml
  - import: <path-to-query-suite>
    from: <ql-pack>
    version: ^x.y.z
  ```

  The `version` field is optional and specifies a range of compatible versions of this {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack.
  If you don’t specify a version, then the most recent version of the pack is used.

  Queries added using an `import` instruction can be filtered using subsequent
  `exclude` instructions.

* An `apply` instruction: Adds all of the instructions from a
previously defined `.qls` file to the current suite. The instructions in the
applied `.qls` file are executed as if they appear in place of `apply`.
Any `include` and `exclude` instructions from the applied suite also act on
queries added by any earlier instructions:

  ```yaml
  - apply: <path-to-query-suite>
  ```

  The `apply` instruction can also be used to apply a set of reusable
  conditions, saved in a `.yml` file, to multiple query definitions. For more
  information, see the [examples](#reusability-examples) below.

### Reusability Examples

To use the same conditions in multiple query suite definitions, create a
separate `.yml` file containing your instructions. For example, save the
following in a file called `reusable-instructions.yml`:

```yaml
- include:
    kind:
    - problem
    - path-problem
    tags contain: security
    precision:
    - high
    - very-high
```

Add `reusable-instructions.yml` to the same {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack as your current query
suite. Then, in one or more query suites, use the `apply` instruction to apply
the reusable instructions to the current suite. For example:

```yaml
- queries: queries/cpp/custom
- apply: reusable-instructions.yml
```

This will filter the queries in `queries/cpp/custom` to only include those that match the reusable conditions.

You can also create a suite definition using `reusable-instructions.yml` on
queries in a different {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack. If the `.qls` file is in the same {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack as
the queries, you can add a `from` field immediately after the `apply`
instruction:

```yaml
# load queries from the default suite of my-org/my-other-custom-queries
- qlpack: my-org/my-other-custom-queries

# apply the reusable instructions from the my-org/my-custom-instructions {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} pack
- apply: reusable-instructions.yml
  from: my-org/my-custom-instructions
  version: ^1.2.3 # optional
```

A common use case for an `import` instruction is to apply a further filter to queries from another
query suite. For example, this suite will further filter the `cpp-security-and-quality` suite
and exclude `low` and `medium` precision queries:

```yaml
- import: codeql-suites/cpp-security-and-quality.qls
  from: codeql/cpp-queries
- exclude:
    precision:
      - low
      - medium
```

If you want to `include` queries imported from another suite, the syntax is a little different:

```yaml
- import: codeql-suites/cpp-security-and-quality.qls
  from: codeql/cpp-queries
- exclude: {}
- include:
    precision:
      - very-high
      - high
```

Notice the empty `exclude` instruction. This is required to ensure that the subsequent `include`
instruction is able to filter queries from the imported suite.

## Naming a query suite

You can provide a name for your query suite by specifying a `description`
instruction:

```yaml
- description: <name-of-query-suite>
```

## Saving a query suite

Save your query suite in a file with a `.qls` extension and add it to a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}
pack. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/customizing-analysis-with-codeql-packs#custom-codeql-packs).

## Using query suites with {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}

You can specify query suites on the command line for any command that accepts
`.qls` files. For example, you can compile the queries selected by a suite
definition using `query compile`, or use the queries in an analysis using
`database analyze`. For more information about analyzing {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} databases, see
[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/analyzing-your-code-with-codeql-queries).

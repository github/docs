## About {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspaces

{% data reusables.code-scanning.codeql-action-version-ghes %}

You use a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace when you want to group multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs together. A typical use case for a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace is to develop a set of {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} library and query packs that are mutually dependent. For more information on {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/customizing-analysis-with-codeql-packs).

The main benefit of a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace is that it makes it easier for you to develop and maintain multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs. When you use a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace, all the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs in the workspace are available as _source dependencies_ for each other when you run a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} command that resolves queries. This makes it easier to develop, maintain, and publish multiple, related {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs.

In most cases, you should store the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace and the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs contained in it in one git repository. This makes it easier to share your {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} development environment.

## The `codeql-workspace.yml` file

A {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace is defined by a `codeql-workspace.yml` yaml file. This file contains a `provide` block, and optionally `ignore` and `registries` blocks.

* The `provide` block contains a list of glob patterns that define the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs that are available in the workspace.

* The `ignore` block contains a list of glob patterns that define {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs that are not available in the workspace.

* The `registries` block contains a list of GHES URLs and package patterns that control which container registry is used for publishing {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/publishing-and-using-codeql-packs#working-with-codeql-packs-on-ghes).

Each entry in the `provide` or `ignore` section must map to the location of a `qlpack.yml` file. All glob patterns are defined relative to the directory that contains the workspace file. For a list of patterns accepted in this file, see [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob#patterns).

For example, the following `codeql-workspace.yml` file defines a workspace that contains all the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs recursively found in the `codeql-packs` directory, except for the packs in the `experimental` directory. The `registries` block specifies that `codeql/\*` packs should be downloaded from `https://ghcr.io/v2/`, which is {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}’s default container registry. All other packs should be downloaded from and published to the registry at `GHE_HOSTNAME`.

```yaml
provide:
  - "*/codeql-packs/**/qlpack.yml"
ignore:
  - "*/codeql-packs/**/experimental/**/qlpack.yml"

registries:
 - packages: 'codeql/*'
   url: https://ghcr.io/v2/

 - packages: '*'
   url: https://containers.GHE_HOSTNAME/v2/
```

To verify that your `codeql-workspace.yml` file includes the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs that you expect, run the `codeql pack ls` command in the same directory as your workspace. The result of the command is a list of all {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs in the workspace.

## Source dependencies

Source dependencies are {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs that are resolved from the local file system outside of the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} package cache. These dependencies can be in the same {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspace, or specified as a path option using the `--additional-packs` argument. When you compile and run queries locally, source dependencies override any dependencies found in the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} package cache as well as version constraints defined in the `qlpack.yml`. All references to {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs in the same workspace are resolved as source dependencies.

This is particularly useful in the following situations:

* One of the dependencies of the query pack you are running is not yet published. Resolving from source is the only way to reference that pack.

* You are making changes to multiple packs at the same time and want to test them together. Resolving from source ensures that you are using the version of the pack with your changes in it.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workspaces and query resolution

All {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs in a workspace are available as source dependencies for each other when you run any {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} command that resolves queries or packs. For example, when you run `codeql pack install` in a pack directory in a workspace, any dependency that can be found in the workspace will be used instead of downloading that dependency to the package cache and adding it to the `codeql-pack.lock.yml` file. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/codeql-cli/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs#adding-and-installing-dependencies).

Similarly, when you publish a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query pack to the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} container registry using `codeql pack publish` the command will always use the dependencies from the workspace instead of using dependencies found in the local package cache.

This ensures that any local changes you make to a query library in a dependency are automatically reflected in any query packs you publish from that workspace.

### Example

Consider the following `codeql-workspace.yml` file:

```yaml
provide:
  - "**/qlpack.yml"
```

And the following {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} library pack `qlpack.yml` file in the workspace:

```yaml
name: my-company/my-library
library: true
version: 1.0.0
```

And the following {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query pack `qlpack.yml` file in the workspace:

```yaml
name: my-company/my-queries
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  my-company/my-library: "*"
  codeql/cpp-all: ~0.2.0
```

Notice that the `dependencies` block for the {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} query pack, `my-company/my-queries`, specifies `"*"` as the version of the library pack. Since the library pack is already defined as a source dependency in `codeql-workspace.yml`, the library pack’s content is always resolved from inside the workspace. Any version constraint you define will be ignored in this case. We recommend that you use `"*"` for source dependencies to make it clear that the version is inherited from the workspace.

When you execute `codeql pack install` from the query pack directory, an appropriate version of `codeql/cpp-all` is downloaded to the local package cache. Also, a `codeql-pack.lock.yml` file is created that contains the resolved version of `codeql/cpp-all`. The lock file won’t contain an entry for `my-company/my-library` since it is resolved from source dependencies. The `codeql-pack.lock.yml` file will look something like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  codeql/cpp-all:
    version: 0.2.2
```

When you execute `codeql pack publish` from the query pack directory, the `codeql/cpp-all` dependency from the package cache and the `my-company/my-library` from the workspace are bundled with `my-company/my-queries` and published to the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} container registry.

## Using `${workspace}` as a version range in `qlpack.yml` files

{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} packs in a workspace can use the special `${workspace}`, `~${workspace}`, and `^${workspace}` version range placeholders. These placeholders indicate that this pack depends on the version of the specified pack that is currently in the workspace. This placeholder is typically used for dependencies inside of library packs to ensure that when they are published, the dependencies in their `qlpack.yml` file reflect the state of the workspace when they were published.

### Example

Consider the following two library packs in the same workspace:

```yaml
name: my-company/my-library
library: true
version: 1.2.3
dependencies:
  my-company/my-library2: ${workspace}
```

```yaml
name: my-company/my-library2
library: true
version: 4.5.6
```

When `my-company/my-library` is published to the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} container registry, the version of the `my-company/my-library2` dependency in the published `qlpack.yml` file will be written as `4.5.6`.

Similarly, if the dependency is `my-company/my-library2: ^${workspace}` in the source pack, and then the pack is published, the version of the `my-company/my-library2` dependency in the published `qlpack.yml` file will be written as `^4.5.6`, indicating that versions `>= 4.5.6` and `< 5.0.0` are all compatible with this library pack.

If the dependency is `my-company/my-library2: ~${workspace}` in the source pack, and then the pack is published, the version of the `my-company/my-library2` dependency in the published `qlpack.yml` file will be written as `~4.5.6`, indicating that versions `>= 4.5.6` and `< 4.6.0` are all compatible with this library pack.

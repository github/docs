If you follow these best practices it will help you to provide a good customer experience.

## Customer communication

* Marketing materials for the app should accurately represent the app's behavior.
* Apps should include links to user-facing documentation that describe how to set up and use the app.
* Customers should be able to see what type of plan they have in the billing, profile, or account settings section of the app.
* Customers should be able to install and use your app on both a personal account and an organization account. They should be able to view and manage the app on those accounts separately.
* Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. Apps should delete all {% data variables.product.company_short %} user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with {% data variables.product.company_short %}.

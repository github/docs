{% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-apps-not-actions %}

<!--UI-LINK: Displayed as a link on the https://github.com/marketplace/new page.-->

The requirements for listing an app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} vary according to whether you want to offer a free or a paid app.

## Requirements for all {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listings

All listings on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} should be for tools that provide value to the {% data variables.product.product_name %} community. When you submit your listing for publication, you must read and accept the terms of the "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-marketplace-developer-agreement)."

### User experience requirements for all apps

All listings should meet the following requirements, regardless of whether they are for a free or paid app.

* Listings must not actively persuade users away from {% data variables.product.product_name %}.
* Listings must include valid contact information for the publisher.
* Listings must have a relevant description of the application.
* Listings must specify a pricing plan.
* Apps must provide value to customers and integrate with the platform in some way beyond authentication.
* Apps must be publicly available in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} and cannot be in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} or available by invite only, with the exception of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %}.
* Apps must have webhook events set up to notify the publisher of any plan changes or cancellations using the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app)."

For more information on providing a good customer experience, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/customer-experience-best-practices-for-apps)."

### Brand and listing requirements for all apps

* Apps that use GitHub logos must follow the {% data variables.product.company_short %} guidelines. For more information, see "[{% data variables.product.company_short %} Logos and Usage](https://github.com/logos)."
* Apps must have a logo, feature card, and screenshots images that meet the recommendations provided in "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/writing-a-listing-description-for-your-app)."
* Listings must include descriptions that are well written and free of grammatical errors. For guidance in writing your listing, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/writing-a-listing-description-for-your-app)."

To protect your customers, we recommend that you also follow security best practices. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/security-best-practices-for-apps-on-github-marketplace)."

## Considerations for free apps

{% data reusables.marketplace.free-apps-encouraged %}

## Requirements for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} are essentially {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} with additional read access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}, integration with the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} API, and optional integration into other LLMs.

To publish an extension, it must be owned by an organization account with Verified Creator status. For more information about the verification process or transferring ownership of your app, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization)."

The requirements to publish a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %} are the same as the requirements for free apps, with the following exceptions:
* Your extension must provide a clear and descriptive response to a prompt like "What can you do?" or "List your capabilities".
* Your extension can be in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} as long as that is clearly communicated in the listing description. If you are using a waitlist, you must also include a link to sign up at the top of the description. Someone from the {% data variables.product.github %} review team will join the waitlist and email your technical lead requesting access for testing.
* You must include links to two videos that demonstrate the following:
    * A few example prompts and responses from your extension
    * A net new user installing, authenticating, and sending their first prompt to your extension

  These videos are private to {% data variables.product.github %} and are used solely for reviewing your listing submission. The videos can be brief, and you don't need to edit them.
* Your extension must provide a stable and reliable user experience, and be able to perform the capabilities listed in the description.
* You must provide a pathway for new users to install, set up, and authorize your extension with minimal friction. If the {% data variables.product.github %} review team is not able to successfully test your extension, it will not be approved for publishing.

## Requirements for paid apps

To publish a paid plan for your app on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, your app must be owned by an organization that is a verified publisher. For more information about the verification process or transferring ownership of your app, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization)."

If your app is already published and you're a verified publisher, then you can publish a new paid plan from the pricing plan editor. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing)."

To publish a paid app (or an app that offers a paid plan), you must also meet the following requirements:

* {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} should have a minimum of 100 installations.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %} should have a minimum of 200 users.
* All paid apps must handle {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events for new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials. For more information, see "[Billing requirements for paid apps](#billing-requirements-for-paid-apps)" below.

When you are ready to publish the app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} you must request verification for the app listing.

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.marketplace.app-transfer-to-org-for-verification %} For information on how to transfer an app to an organization, see: "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/submitting-your-listing-for-publication#transferring-an-app-to-an-organization-before-you-submit)."

{% endnote %}

## Billing requirements for paid apps

Your app does not need to handle payments but does need to use {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events to manage new purchases, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and free trials. For information about how integrate these events into your app, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app)."

Using {% data variables.product.github %}'s billing API allows customers to purchase an app without leaving {% data variables.product.github %} and to pay for the service with the payment method already attached to their account on {% data variables.product.github %}.

* Apps must support both monthly and annual billing for paid subscriptions purchases.
* Listings may offer any combination of free and paid plans. Free plans are optional but encouraged. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing)."

## Understanding the billing cycle

Customers can choose a monthly or yearly billing cycle when they purchase your app. All changes customers make to the billing cycle and plan selection will trigger a `marketplace_purchase` event. You can refer to the `marketplace_purchase` webhook payload to see which billing cycle a customer selects and when the next billing date begins (`effective_date`). For more information about webhook payloads, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/webhook-events-for-the-github-marketplace-api)."

## Providing billing services in your app's UI

Customers should be able to perform the following actions from your app's website:
* Customers should be able to modify or cancel their {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} plans for personal and organizational accounts separately.

## Billing services for upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations

Follow these guidelines for upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations to maintain a clear and consistent billing process. For more detailed instructions about the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} purchase events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app)."

You can use the `marketplace_purchase` webhook's `effective_date` key to determine when a plan change will occur and periodically synchronize the [List accounts for a plan](/rest/apps/marketplace#list-accounts-for-a-plan).

### Upgrades

When a customer upgrades their pricing plan or changes their billing cycle from monthly to yearly, you should make the change effective for them immediately. You need to apply a pro-rated discount to the new plan and change the billing cycle.

For information about building upgrade and downgrade workflows into your app, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/handling-plan-changes)."

### Downgrades and cancellations

Downgrades occur when a customer moves to a free plan from a paid plan, selects a plan with a lower cost than their current plan, or changes their billing cycle from yearly to monthly. When downgrades or cancellations occur, you don't need to provide a refund. Instead, the current plan will remain active until the last day of the current billing cycle. The `marketplace_purchase` event will be sent when the new plan takes effect at the beginning of the customer's next billing cycle.

When a customer cancels a plan, you must:
* Automatically downgrade them to the free plan, if it exists.

  {% data reusables.marketplace.cancellation-clarification %}
* Enable them to upgrade the plan through GitHub if they would like to continue the plan at a later time.

For information about building cancellation workflows into your app, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/handling-plan-cancellations)."

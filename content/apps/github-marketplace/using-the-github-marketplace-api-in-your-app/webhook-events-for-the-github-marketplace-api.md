For more information about the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhook payload, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#marketplace_purchase)."

Webhooks `POST` requests have special headers. See "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#delivery-headers)" for more details. GitHub doesn't resend failed delivery attempts. Ensure your app can receive all webhook payloads sent by GitHub. For information about how to create and disable {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhooks, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/using-webhooks/disabling-webhooks)."

Cancellations and downgrades take effect on the first day of the next billing cycle. Events for downgrades and cancellations are sent when the new plan takes effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. Events for new purchases and upgrades begin immediately. Use the `effective_date` in the webhook payload to determine when a change will begin.

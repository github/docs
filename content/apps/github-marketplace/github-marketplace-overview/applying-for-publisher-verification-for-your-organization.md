{% data reusables.marketplace.marketplace-apps-not-actions %}

Publisher verification ensures that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has a way to contact you, that you've enabled two-factor authentication for your organization, and that your organization's domain has been verified.

Once your organization has been verified, you can publish paid plans for your app. For information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing)."

To offer paid plans for your app, the app must be owned by an organization and you must have owner permissions in the organization. If your app is currently owned by a personal account, you'll need to transfer the ownership of the app to an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app)" or "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/transferring-ownership-of-an-oauth-app)."

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a command line interface (CLI) backed by a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}, and how to use the device flow to generate a user access token for the app.

The CLI will have three commands:

* `help`: Outputs the usage instructions.
* `login`: Generates a user access token that the app can use to make API requests on behalf of the user.
* `whoami`: Returns information about the logged in user.

This tutorial uses Ruby, but you can write a CLI and use the device flow to generate a user access token with any programming language.

### About device flow and user access tokens

The CLI will use the device flow to authenticate a user and generate a user access token. Then, the CLI can use the user access token to make API requests on behalf of the authenticated user.

Your app should use a user access token if you want to attribute the app's actions to a user. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-with-a-github-app-on-behalf-of-a-user).

There are two ways to generate a user access token for a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}: web application flow and device flow. You should use the device flow to generate a user access token if your app is headless or does not have access to a web interface. For example, CLI tools, simple Raspberry Pis, and desktop applications should use the device flow. If your app has access to a web interface, you should use web application flow instead. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app) and [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/guides/using-the-web-application-flow-to-generate-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app).

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have already registered a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. For more information about registering a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app).

Before following this tutorial, you must enable device flow for your app. For more information about enabling device flow for your app, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app).

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Ruby. For more information, see [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

## Get the client ID

You will need your app's client ID in order to generate a user access token via the device flow.

{% data reusables.apps.settings-step %}
{% data reusables.apps.enterprise-apps-steps %}
1. Next to the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} that you want to work with, click **Edit**.
1. On the app's settings page, find the client ID for your app. You will use it later in this tutorial. Note that the client ID is different from the app ID.

## Write the CLI

These steps lead you through building a CLI and using device flow to get a user access token. To skip ahead to the final code, see [Full code example](#full-code-example).

### Setup

1. Create a Ruby file to hold the code that will generate a user access token. This tutorial will name the file `app_cli.rb`.
1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run the following command to make `app_cli.rb` executable:

   ```text copy
   chmod +x app_cli.rb
   ```

1. Add this line to the top of `app_cli.rb` to indicate that the Ruby interpreter should be used to run the script:

   ```ruby copy
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
   ```

1. Add these dependencies to the top of `app_cli.rb`, following `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`:

   ```ruby copy
   require "net/http"
   require "json"
   require "uri"
   require "fileutils"
   ```

   These are all part of the Ruby standard library, so you don't need to install any gems.
1. Add the following `main` function that will serve as an entry point. The function includes a `case` statement to take different actions depending on which command is specified. You will expand this `case` statement later.

   ```ruby copy
   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       puts "`help` is not yet defined"
     when "login"
       puts "`login` is not yet defined"
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command `#{ARGV[0]}`"
     end
   end
   ```

1. At the bottom of the file, add the following line to call the entry point function. This function call should remain at the bottom of your file as you add more functions to this file later in the tutorial.

   ```ruby copy
   main
   ```

1. Optionally, check your progress:

   `app_cli.rb` now looks like this:

   ```ruby copy
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby

   require "net/http"
   require "json"
   require "uri"
   require "fileutils"

   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       puts "`help` is not yet defined"
     when "login"
       puts "`login` is not yet defined"
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command `#{ARGV[0]}`"
     end
   end

   main
   ```

   In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb help`. You should see this output:

   ```shell
   `help` is not yet defined
   ```

   You can also test your script without a command or with an unhandled command. For example, `./app_cli.rb create-issue` should output:

   ```shell
   Unknown command `create-issue`
   ```

### Add a `help` command

1. Add the following `help` function to `app_cli.rb`. Currently, the `help` function prints a line to tell users that this CLI takes one command, "help". You will expand this `help` function later.

   ```ruby copy
   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <help>"
   end
   ```

1. Update the `main` function to call the `help` function when the `help` command is given:

   ```ruby copy
   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       puts "`login` is not yet defined"
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end
   ```

1. Optionally, check your progress:

   `app_cli.rb` now looks like this. The order of the functions doesn't matter as long as the `main` function call is at the end of the file.

   ```ruby copy
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby

   require "net/http"
   require "json"
   require "uri"
   require "fileutils"

   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <help>"
   end

   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       puts "`login` is not yet defined"
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end

   main
   ```

   In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb help`. You should see this output:

   ```shell
   usage: app_cli <help>
   ```

### Add a `login` command

The `login` command will run the device flow to get a user access token. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app#using-the-device-flow-to-generate-a-user-access-token).

1. Near the top of your file, after the `require` statements, add the `CLIENT_ID` of your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} as a constant in `app_cli.rb`. For more information about finding your app's client ID, see [Get the client ID](#get-the-client-id). Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the client ID of your app:

   ```ruby copy
   CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
   ```

1. Add the following `parse_response` function to `app_cli.rb`. This function parses a response from the {% data variables.product.company_short %} REST API. When the response status is `200 OK` or `201 Created`, the function returns the parsed response body. Otherwise, the function prints the response and body and exits the program.

   ```ruby copy
   def parse_response(response)
     case response
     when Net::HTTPOK, Net::HTTPCreated
       JSON.parse(response.body)
     else
       puts response
       puts response.body
       exit 1
     end
   end
   ```

1. Add the following `request_device_code` function to `app_cli.rb`. This function makes a `POST` request to `{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device/code` and returns the response.

   ```ruby copy
   def request_device_code
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device/code")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form("client_id" => CLIENT_ID)
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}

     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end
   ```

1. Add the following `request_token` function to `app_cli.rb`. This function makes a `POST` request to `{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token` and returns the response.

   ```ruby copy
   def request_token(device_code)
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form({
       "client_id" => CLIENT_ID,
       "device_code" => device_code,
       "grant_type" => "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"
     })
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}
     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end
   ```

1. Add the following `poll_for_token` function to `app_cli.rb`. This function polls `{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token` at the specified interval until {% data variables.product.company_short %} responds with an `access_token` parameter instead of an `error` parameter. Then, it writes the user access token to a file and restricts the permissions on the file.

   ```ruby copy
   def poll_for_token(device_code, interval)

     loop do
       response = request_token(device_code)
       error, access_token = response.values_at("error", "access_token")

       if error
         case error
         when "authorization_pending"
           # The user has not yet entered the code.
           # Wait, then poll again.
           sleep interval
           next
         when "slow_down"
           # The app polled too fast.
           # Wait for the interval plus 5 seconds, then poll again.
           sleep interval + 5
           next
         when "expired_token"
           # The `device_code` expired, and the process needs to restart.
           puts "The device code has expired. Please run `login` again."
           exit 1
         when "access_denied"
           # The user cancelled the process. Stop polling.
           puts "Login cancelled by user."
           exit 1
         else
           puts response
           exit 1
         end
       end

       File.write("./.token", access_token)

       # Set the file permissions so that only the file owner can read or modify the file
       FileUtils.chmod(0600, "./.token")

       break
     end
   end
   ```

1. Add the following `login` function.

   This function:

   1. Calls the `request_device_code` function and gets the `verification_uri`, `user_code`, `device_code`, and `interval` parameters from the response.
   1. Prompts users to enter the `user_code` from the previous step.
   1. Calls the `poll_for_token` to poll {% data variables.product.company_short %} for an access token.
   1. Lets the user know that authentication was successful.

   ```ruby copy
   def login
     verification_uri, user_code, device_code, interval = request_device_code.values_at("verification_uri", "user_code", "device_code", "interval")

     puts "Please visit: #{verification_uri}"
     puts "and enter code: #{user_code}"

     poll_for_token(device_code, interval)

     puts "Successfully authenticated!"
   end
   ```

1. Update the `main` function to call the `login` function when the `login` command is given:

   ```ruby copy
   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       login
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end
   ```

1. Update the `help` function to include the `login` command:

   ```ruby copy
   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <login | help>"
   end
   ```

1. Optionally, check your progress:

   `app_cli.rb` now looks something like this, where `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` is the client ID of your app. The order of the functions doesn't matter as long as the `main` function call is at the end of the file.

   ```ruby copy
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby

   require "net/http"
   require "json"
   require "uri"
   require "fileutils"

   CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"

   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <login | help>"
   end

   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       login
     when "whoami"
       puts "`whoami` is not yet defined"
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end

   def parse_response(response)
     case response
     when Net::HTTPOK, Net::HTTPCreated
       JSON.parse(response.body)
     else
       puts response
       puts response.body
       exit 1
     end
   end

   def request_device_code
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device/code")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form("client_id" => CLIENT_ID)
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}

     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end

   def request_token(device_code)
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form({
       "client_id" => CLIENT_ID,
       "device_code" => device_code,
       "grant_type" => "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"
     })
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}
     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end

   def poll_for_token(device_code, interval)

     loop do
       response = request_token(device_code)
       error, access_token = response.values_at("error", "access_token")

       if error
         case error
         when "authorization_pending"
           # The user has not yet entered the code.
           # Wait, then poll again.
           sleep interval
           next
         when "slow_down"
           # The app polled too fast.
           # Wait for the interval plus 5 seconds, then poll again.
           sleep interval + 5
           next
         when "expired_token"
           # The `device_code` expired, and the process needs to restart.
           puts "The device code has expired. Please run `login` again."
           exit 1
         when "access_denied"
           # The user cancelled the process. Stop polling.
           puts "Login cancelled by user."
           exit 1
         else
           puts response
           exit 1
         end
       end

       File.write("./.token", access_token)

       # Set the file permissions so that only the file owner can read or modify the file
       FileUtils.chmod(0600, "./.token")

       break
     end
   end

   def login
     verification_uri, user_code, device_code, interval = request_device_code.values_at("verification_uri", "user_code", "device_code", "interval")

     puts "Please visit: #{verification_uri}"
     puts "and enter code: #{user_code}"

     poll_for_token(device_code, interval)

     puts "Successfully authenticated!"
   end

   main
   ```

   1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb login`. You should see output that looks like this. The code will differ every time:

      ```shell
      Please visit: {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device
      and enter code: CA86-8D94
      ```

   1. Navigate to {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device in your browser and enter the code from the previous step, then click **Continue**.
   1. {% data variables.product.company_short %} should display a page that prompts you to authorize your app. Click the "Authorize" button.
   1. Your terminal should now say "Successfully authenticated!".

### Add a `whoami` command

Now that your app can generate a user access token, you can make API requests on behalf of the user. Add a `whoami` command to get the username of the authenticated user.

1. Add the following `whoami` function to `app_cli.rb`. This function gets information about the user with the `/user` REST API endpoint. It outputs the username that corresponds to the user access token. If the `.token` file was not found, it prompts the user to run the `login` function.

   ```ruby copy
   def whoami
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/user")

     begin
       token = File.read("./.token").strip
     rescue Errno::ENOENT => e
       puts "You are not authorized. Run the `login` command."
       exit 1
     end

     response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
       body = {"access_token" => token}.to_json
       headers = {"Accept" => "application/vnd.github+json", "Authorization" => "Bearer #{token}"}

       http.send_request("GET", uri.path, body, headers)
     end

     parsed_response = parse_response(response)
     puts "You are #{parsed_response["login"]}"
   end
   ```

1. Update the `parse_response` function to handle the case where the token has expired or been revoked. Now, if you get a `401 Unauthorized` response, the CLI will prompt the user to run the `login` command.

   ```ruby copy
   def parse_response(response)
     case response
     when Net::HTTPOK, Net::HTTPCreated
       JSON.parse(response.body)
     when Net::HTTPUnauthorized
       puts "You are not authorized. Run the `login` command."
       exit 1
     else
       puts response
       puts response.body
       exit 1
     end
   end
   ```

1. Update the `main` function to call the `whoami` function when the `whoami` command is given:

   ```ruby copy
   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       login
     when "whoami"
       whoami
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end
   ```

1. Update the `help` function to include the `whoami` command:

   ```ruby copy
   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <login | whoami | help>"
   end
   ```

1. Check your code against the full code example in the next section. You can test your code by following the steps outlined in the [Testing](#testing) section below the full code example.

## Full code example

This is the full code example that was outlined in the previous section. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the client ID of your app.

   ```ruby copy
   #!/usr/bin/env ruby

   require "net/http"
   require "json"
   require "uri"
   require "fileutils"

   CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"

   def help
     puts "usage: app_cli <login | whoami | help>"
   end

   def main
     case ARGV[0]
     when "help"
       help
     when "login"
       login
     when "whoami"
       whoami
     else
       puts "Unknown command #{ARGV[0]}"
     end
   end

   def parse_response(response)
     case response
     when Net::HTTPOK, Net::HTTPCreated
       JSON.parse(response.body)
     when Net::HTTPUnauthorized
       puts "You are not authorized. Run the `login` command."
       exit 1
     else
       puts response
       puts response.body
       exit 1
     end
   end

   def request_device_code
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device/code")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form("client_id" => CLIENT_ID)
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}

     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end

   def request_token(device_code)
     uri = URI("{% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/oauth/access_token")
     parameters = URI.encode_www_form({
       "client_id" => CLIENT_ID,
       "device_code" => device_code,
       "grant_type" => "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"
     })
     headers = {"Accept" => "application/json"}
     response = Net::HTTP.post(uri, parameters, headers)
     parse_response(response)
   end

   def poll_for_token(device_code, interval)

     loop do
       response = request_token(device_code)
       error, access_token = response.values_at("error", "access_token")

       if error
         case error
         when "authorization_pending"
           # The user has not yet entered the code.
           # Wait, then poll again.
           sleep interval
           next
         when "slow_down"
           # The app polled too fast.
           # Wait for the interval plus 5 seconds, then poll again.
           sleep interval + 5
           next
         when "expired_token"
           # The `device_code` expired, and the process needs to restart.
           puts "The device code has expired. Please run `login` again."
           exit 1
         when "access_denied"
           # The user cancelled the process. Stop polling.
           puts "Login cancelled by user."
           exit 1
         else
           puts response
           exit 1
         end

## Testing

This tutorial assumes that your app code is stored in a file named `app_cli.rb`.

1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb help`. You should see output that looks like this.

   ```shell
   usage: app_cli <login | whoami | help>
   ```

1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb login`. You should see output that looks like this. The code will differ every time:

   ```shell
   Please visit: {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device
   and enter code: CA86-8D94
   ```

1. Navigate to {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/login/device in your browser and enter the code from the previous step, then click **Continue**.
1. {% data variables.product.company_short %} should display a page that prompts you to authorize your app. Click the "Authorize" button.
1. Your terminal should now say "Successfully authenticated!".
1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb whoami`. You should see output that looks like this, where `octocat` is your username.

   ```shell
   You are octocat
   ```

1. Open the `.token` file in your editor, and modify the token. Now, the token is invalid.
1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb whoami`. You should see output that looks like this:

   ```shell
   You are not authorized. Run the `login` command.
   ```

1. Delete the `.token` file.
1. In your terminal, from the directory where `app_cli.rb` is stored, run `./app_cli.rb whoami`. You should see output that looks like this:

   ```shell
   You are not authorized. Run the `login` command.
   ```

## Next steps

### Adjust the code to meet your app's needs

This tutorial demonstrated how to write a CLI that uses the device flow to generate a user access token. You can expand this CLI to accept additional commands. For example, you can add a `create-issue` command that opens an issue. Remember to update your app's permissions if your app needs additional permissions for the API requests that you want to make. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app).

### Securely store tokens

This tutorial generates a user access token and saves it in a local file. You should never commit this file or publicize the token.

Depending on your device, you may choose different ways to store the token. You should check the best practices for storing tokens on your device.

For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/best-practices-for-creating-a-github-app).

### Follow best practices

You should aim to follow best practices with your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/best-practices-for-creating-a-github-app).

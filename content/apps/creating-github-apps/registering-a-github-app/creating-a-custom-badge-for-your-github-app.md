## About badges

Every {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} has a badge. A badge is a square image inside a circular background.

By default, a new GitHub App will use an automatically generated identicon as a badge. An identicon badge looks something like this:

![Screenshot of an identicon, which consists of white pixels in a random pattern on a circular yellow background.](/assets/images/help/apps/identicon.png)

After you register a GitHub App, you can customize your app's badge by uploading a logo and selecting a background color. Your logo should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend an image dimension of 200 pixels by 200 pixels.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

For more information about badges for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/writing-a-listing-description-for-your-app#guidelines-for-logos). You can change a custom badge for a GitHub App that already has an approved Marketplace listing by navigating to https://github.com/marketplace/manage.

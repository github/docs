## About visibility for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}

A {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} can be {% ifversion fpt %}public or private{% elsif enterprise-apps-public-beta %}public, private, or internal{% endif %}.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to public, any user on {% data variables.product.github %} can install it. If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to private, it can only be installed on the account that owns the app.

{% elsif ghes %} If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to public, anyone on your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance can install it, but the app is not available outside of your instance. If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to private, it can only be installed on the account that owns the app.{% endif %}

{% ifversion enterprise-apps-public-beta %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} owned by an enterprise account{% ifversion ghec %}, or by a {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %} in an enterprise,{% endif %} have "internal" visibility. Internal apps can only be installed by organizations within the enterprise and authorized by users within the enterprise. Members of the enterprise and unaffiliated users can authorize these apps, but outside collaborators cannot.
{% endif %}

If you want your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to be available to organizations in a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that you are not part of, then you need to take additional steps. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/sharing-github-apps/making-your-github-app-available-for-github-enterprise-server).

If it is important for {% ifversion ghes %}other {% endif %}{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} users to be able to use your tool, consider using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} instead of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. Public actions are available on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances with GitHub Connect. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE]({% ifversion not ghes %}/enterprise-server@latest{% endif %}/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect) and [AUTOTITLE]({% ifversion not ghes %}/enterprise-server@latest{% endif %}/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/about-github-actions-for-enterprises){% ifversion ghes %}.{% else %} in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation.{% endif %}

For information about changing the visibility of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app).

{% ifversion enterprise-apps-public-beta %}

### "Internal" installation flow

The app can not be installed on user accounts.

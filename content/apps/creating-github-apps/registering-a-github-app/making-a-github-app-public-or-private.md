## About visibility for {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}

You can make your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration public or private. {% ifversion fpt %}If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to public, any user on {% data variables.product.github %} can install it. If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to private, it can only be installed on the account that owns the app.

{% elsif ghes %}If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to public, anyone on your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance can install it, but the app is not available outside of your instance. If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to private, it can only be installed on the account that owns the app.

{% elsif ghec %}If a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is created by an {% data variables.product.prodname_emu %}, the "Public" option is disabled and the app is only installable by organizations within the {% data variables.product.prodname_emu %} enterprise. {% data variables.product.prodname_emu %} organizations can set their apps to be installable by any other organization in the enterprise, or just the organization that owns it. Apps created within an {% data variables.product.prodname_emu %} account are never installable on accounts outside of your enterprise.

If a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration is owned by an account that is not an {% data variables.product.prodname_emu %}, and the app is set to public, any user on {% data variables.product.github %} can install the app. If you set your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration to private, it can only be installed on the account that owns the app.{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}You can register a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} under your personal account or organization and make it available for other organizations to install. You do not need an enterprise plan or an organization account to make your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} available to an organization even if the organization is owned by an enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.{% endif %}

{% ifversion enterprise-apps-public-beta %}
Additionally, you can register a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} under your enterprise. You can't make this app public, the app can only be installed on organizations within your enterprise, and can only be authorized by members of your enterprise.
{% endif %}

If you want your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to be available to organizations in a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that you are not part of, then you need to take additional steps. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/sharing-github-apps/making-your-github-app-available-for-github-enterprise-server)."

If it is important for {% ifversion ghes %}other {% endif %}{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} users to be able to use your tool, consider using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} instead of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. Public actions are available on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances with GitHub Connect. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE]({% ifversion not ghes %}/enterprise-server@latest{% endif %}/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect)" and "[AUTOTITLE]({% ifversion not ghes %}/enterprise-server@latest{% endif %}/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/about-github-actions-for-enterprises){% ifversion ghes %}."{% else %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation.{% endif %}

For information about changing the visibility of a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} registration, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app)."

### Public installation flow

Public {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} have a landing page with an **Install** button, so that other people can install the app in their repositories. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}If your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is public to all users on {% data variables.product.github %}, you can also choose to publish it to {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/about-github-marketplace)."{% endif %}

### Private installation flow

Private {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} can only be installed on the user or organization account of the app owner. Limited information about the app will exist on a landing page for the app, but the **Install** button will only be available to organization owners and app managers for the organization that owns the app, or the personal account if the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is owned by an individual account.

{% ifversion enterprise-apps-public-beta %}

### Enterprise-owned installation flow

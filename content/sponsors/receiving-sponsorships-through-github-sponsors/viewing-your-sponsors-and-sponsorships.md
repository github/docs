## About sponsors and sponsorships

You can view analytics on your current and past sponsorships, the payments you've received from sponsors, and events, such as cancellations and sponsor tier changes for your sponsorships. You can also view activity such as new sponsorships, changes to sponsorships, and canceled sponsorships. You can filter the list of activities by date. You can also export sponsorship data for the account you're viewing in CSV or JSON format.

## About transaction metadata

To track where your sponsorships are coming from, you can use custom URLs with metadata for your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} profile or checkout page. The metadata will be included in your transaction export in the metadata column. For more information about exporting transaction data, see "[Exporting your sponsorship data](#exporting-your-sponsorship-data)."

Metadata must use the `key=value` format and can be added to the end of these URLs.

* Sponsored account profile: `https://github.com/sponsors/{account}`
* Sponsorship checkout: `https://github.com/sponsors/{account}/sponsorships`

The metadata will persist in the URL as a potential sponsor switches accounts to sponsor with, selects monthly or one-time payments, and chooses a different tier.

### Syntax requirements

Your metadata must meet the following requirements, which do not apply to any other URL parameters that are passed.

* Keys must be prefixed by `metadata_`, such as `metadata_campaign`. In your transaction export, the `metadata_` prefix will be removed from the key.
* Keys and values must only contain alphanumeric values, dashes, or underscores. If non-accepted characters are passed in either keys or values, a 404 error will be presented.
* Whitespaces are not allowed.
* A maximum of **10** key-value pairs are accepted per request. If more are passed, only the first 10 will be saved.
* A maximum of **25** characters per key are accepted. If more than that are passed, only the first 25 will be saved.
* A maximum of **100** characters per value are accepted. If more than that are passed, only the first 100 will be saved.

For example, you can use `https://github.com/sponsors/{account}?metadata_campaign=myblog` to track sponsorships that originate from your blog. `metadata_campaign` is the key and `myblog` is the value. In the metadata column of your transaction export, the key will be listed as `campaign`.

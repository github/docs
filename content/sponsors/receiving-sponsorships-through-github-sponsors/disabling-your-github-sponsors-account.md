If you are receiving sponsorship payments, you'll need to contact GitHub Support to disable your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} account.

If you don't have any sponsors, then you can disable your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} account on GitHub.

If you decide to create a {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} account again, you'll need to reapply.

Alternatively, you can unpublish your sponsors profile and then republish the account without reapplying again. For more information, see "[Unpublishing your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} profile](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/unpublishing-your-github-sponsors-profile)."

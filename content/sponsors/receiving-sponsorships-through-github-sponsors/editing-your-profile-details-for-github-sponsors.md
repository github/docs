## About sponsor profiles

Your {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} profile tells potential sponsors why they should support you. People see your sponsor profile when they click the **Sponsor** button on your profile. We recommend including the following information.

- Open source work that you contribute to
- Why you are committed to open source development

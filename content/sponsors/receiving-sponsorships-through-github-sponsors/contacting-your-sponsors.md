## About sponsorship updates

Your sponsors can choose whether they receive email updates about your work. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/managing-your-sponsorship)."

For sponsored developer accounts, the update will come from your personal account's primary email address. If you've enabled email address privacy on your personal account, the update will come from `noreply@github.com` instead. For sponsored organizations, the update will come from the organization's `noreply@github.com` email address. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)."

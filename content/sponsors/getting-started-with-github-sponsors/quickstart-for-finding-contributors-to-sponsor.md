## Explore projects you depend on

As you consider where to find open source contributors to sponsor, consider starting at https://github.com/sponsors/community.

If you're logged in, the sponsors results will start with public dependencies that your repositories depend on.

Using the "Explore as," "Ecosystem," and "Filters" sidebar menus, you can also toggle which of your accounts to view dependencies for and further filter your results.

## Explore whom others sponsor

You can see whom a user or organization sponsors on their {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} profile page.

## Consider how you benefit from different contributions

Consider whether you benefit from the work of open source contributions, such as:
- Documentation
- Design
- Translation
- Newsletters
- Code reviews
- Tutorials
- Mentoring
- Triaging issues and helping with project management
- Answering questions
- Event planning

For more information on different types of open source contributions, see the [Open source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#you-dont-have-to-contribute-code).

You can check if contributors you've benefited from have {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} profiles by using search at https://github.com/sponsors/community.

## Search for a specific project or contributor

At https://github.com/sponsors/community, you can search by ecosystem, most used, recently updated, and more. You can filter search results for your personal account or for organizations that you're a member of.

## About your Sponsors dashboard

From your sponsors dashboard, you can view current and past sponsorships and dependencies, manage your recent invoices and sponsor settings, and create bulk sponsorships.

## Viewing your sponsorships

On your sponsorships page, you can display your current invoice balance, and see options to open a support ticket and create an invoice.

You can also manage current sponsorships and view past sponsorships, and export your current and past sponsorships as a CSV file.

{% data reusables.organizations.sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-sponsoring %}
1. From the left sidebar, click **{% octicon "heart" aria-hidden="true" %} Your sponsorships**.

## Viewing dependencies

You can view dependencies that have an active sponsors profile, search for specific dependencies, view repositories your sponsors own or maintain, and see when your sponsors were last active.

You can also export the list of dependencies as a CSV file.

{% data reusables.organizations.sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-sponsoring %}
1. From the left sidebar, click **{% octicon "package-dependencies" aria-hidden="true" %} Dependencies**.

## Viewing bulk sponsorships

You can create a bulk sponsorship from your organization's sponsorships page.

{% data reusables.organizations.sponsors-dashboard %}
{% data reusables.organizations.navigate-to-sponsoring %}
1. From the left sidebar, click **Bulk Sponsors**.

## Viewing invoices

You can manage your open and paid invoices from your sponsors dashboard. To be able to add funds to your balance, you must first create a new invoice. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/paying-for-github-sponsors-by-invoice#creating-a-new-invoice).

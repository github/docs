## About sponsoring through Patreon

Rather than paying through {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can choose to sponsor eligible maintainers through Patreon on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

To sponsor through Patreon on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, both you and the selected maintainer must link your Patreon accounts to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} accounts. You can then choose to sponsor maintainers through Patreon on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, or you can sponsor the maintainer directly through the Patreon website while receiving recognition on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information on sponsoring through the Patreon website, see [Become a patron of a creator](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913709-Become-a-patron-of-a-creator) in the Patreon documentation.

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} displays all published Patreon sponsorship tiers. Only Patreon sponsorships that respect the maintainer's minimum amount on {% data variables.product.company_short %} will be recognized. If you sponsor a maintainer both on {% data variables.product.company_short %} and Patreon, the higher value sponsorship will be prioritized when describing the relationship between a sponsor and a maintainer.

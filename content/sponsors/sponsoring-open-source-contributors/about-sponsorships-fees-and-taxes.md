## About sponsorships

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %}

You can sponsor an account on behalf of your personal account to invest in projects that you personally benefit from. You can sponsor an account on behalf of your organization for many reasons.
* Sustaining specific libraries that your organization's work depends on
* Investing in the ecosystem you rely on as an organization (such as blockchain)
* Developing brand awareness as an organization that values open source
* Thanking open source developers for building libraries that complement the product your organization offers

We may share certain limited tax information with sponsored accounts. For more information, see "[Tax information](#tax-information)."

You can choose whether to display your sponsorship publicly. One-time sponsorships remain visible for one month.

If the sponsored account retires your tier, the tier will remain in place for you until you choose a different tier or cancel your subscription. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-sponsors/upgrading-a-sponsorship)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-sponsors/downgrading-a-sponsorship)."

If the account you want to sponsor does not have a profile on {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, you can encourage the account to join. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is not responsible for how developers represent themselves nor does {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} endorse any sponsored open source projects. The claims are solely the responsibility of the developer receiving the funds. Make sure you trust a person before offering a sponsorship. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} Additional Terms](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/github-terms/github-sponsors-additional-terms).

{% endnote %}

Alternatively, enterprises and organizations may opt to be billed by recurring invoice. For additional information on billing by invoice, please click on [AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/paying-for-github-sponsors-by-invoice).

**Warning:** As of February 23, 2023, GitHub Sponsors does not support PayPal. While this only affects GitHub Sponsors, please note that it is still possible to fund GitHub Pro, GitHub Copilot, Actions and Packages, Storage, Codespaces and Git LFS Data using PayPal.

When an enterprise opts to pay by credit card, it can enforce policies within its organizations that allow sponsoring of open source contributors by payments from the same card that was used for billing.

## Using the sponsorships dashboard for organizations

You can use the sponsorships dashboard to see an overview of active and past sponsorships. Organization owners can use the dashboard to see how much they are paying, make changes to sponsorships, and export their sponsorships as a CSV file. Non-members and people signed out of {% data variables.product.product_name %} can see public sponsorships and organization members can see public and private sponsorships.

You can access the sponsorships dashboard through your organization's profile.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
1. Under your organization name, click {% octicon "heart" aria-hidden="true" %} **Sponsoring**.

* Transaction date
* Amount paid
* The country, state, and province from where payment was made
* Whether payment was made by a business or individual

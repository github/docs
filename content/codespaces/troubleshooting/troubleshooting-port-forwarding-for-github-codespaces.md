When an application running inside a codespace outputs a port to the console, {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}  detects the localhost URL pattern and automatically forwards the port. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace)."

If a port is not automatically forwarded, you can forward it manually. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#forwarding-a-port)."

If port forwarding is set up, check the following:

* Use the link in the notification "toast" message, that pops up in the bottom right corner of {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}, or click the URL in Terminal, to open the forwarded port. Typing in `localhost:8000` (as an example) to your local machine will not work if you're connected to the codespace via the browser.
* Make sure to check that your application is still running from within your codespace. If your codespace has stopped after a period of inactivity, you'll need to ensure to restart your application once the codespace has restarted.

Typically, you can make a forwarded port accessible publicly, or within the organization that owns a repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace)." If either, or both, of the options for public or organization visibility are not available, this indicates that an organization-level policy has been configured. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-the-visibility-of-forwarded-ports)."

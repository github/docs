## Checking whether a codespace was created from a prebuild?

When you create a codespace, you can choose the type of the virtual machine you want to use. If a prebuild is available for the type of virtual machine, "{% octicon "zap" aria-hidden="true" %} Prebuild ready" is shown next to it.

If you have your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} editor preference set to "{% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} for Web" then the "Setting up your codespace" page will show the message "Prebuilt codespace found" if a prebuild is being used.

Similarly, if your editor preference is "{% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %}" then the integrated terminal will contain the message "You are on a prebuilt codespace defined by the prebuild configuration for your repository" when you create a new codespace. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/setting-your-default-editor-for-github-codespaces).

After you have created a codespace you can check whether it was created from a prebuild by running the following {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} command in the terminal:

```shell copy
gh api /user/codespaces/$CODESPACE_NAME --jq .prebuild
```

This returns `true` if the codespace was created using a prebuild.

Alternatively, if {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} (`gh`) is not installed, you can use the following command, which returns `createFromPrebuild` if the codespace was created from a prebuild:

```shell copy
cat /workspaces/.codespaces/shared/environment-variables.json | jq '.ACTION_NAME'
```

## Checking prebuild usage

You can check whether a repository is using prebuilds in the "{% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}" page of the repository's settings.

You can check how much storage space has been consumed by prebuilds in your current billing cycle by reviewing the billing data for your personal or organization account. You can also generate a usage report to see which repositories have been using prebuilds. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/viewing-your-github-codespaces-usage).

## The "Prebuild Ready" label is sometimes missing

You may notice that sometimes, when you create a new codespace from a prebuild-enabled branch, the "{% octicon "zap" aria-hidden="true" %} Prebuild Ready" label is not displayed in the dialog box for choosing a machine type. This means that prebuilds are not currently available.

By default, each time you push to a prebuild-enabled branch, the prebuild is updated. If the push involves a change to the dev container configuration then, while the update is in progress, the "{% octicon "zap" aria-hidden="true" %} Prebuild Ready" label is removed from the list of machine types. During this time you can still create codespaces without a prebuild. If required, you can reduce the occasions on which prebuilds are unavailable for a repository by setting the prebuild to be updated only when you make a change to your dev container configuration files, or only on a custom schedule. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/configuring-prebuilds#configuring-prebuilds).

If your branch is not specifically enabled for prebuilds it may still benefit from prebuilds if it was branched from a prebuild-enabled branch. However, if the dev container configuration is changed on your branch, so that it's not the same as the configuration on the base branch, prebuilds will no longer be available on your branch.

Here are things to check if the "{% octicon "zap" aria-hidden="true" %} Prebuild Ready" label is not displayed for a particular branch:

* Confirm that a prebuild configuration exists for this branch. If youâ€™re not a repository administrator, you'll need to reach out to one to confirm this.
* Confirm that the prebuild configuration includes your region.
* Check whether a change to the dev container configuration was pushed to the prebuild-enabled branch recently. If so, you will typically have to wait until the prebuild workflow run for this push completes before prebuilds are available again.
* If no configuration changes were recently made, go to the **Actions** tab of your repository, click **{% octicon "codespaces" aria-hidden="true" %} {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %} Prebuilds** in the workflows list, and check that prebuild workflow runs for the branch are succeeding. If latest runs of a workflow failed, and one or more of these failed runs contained changes to the dev container configuration, then there will be no available prebuilds for the associated branch.

## Some resources cannot be accessed in codespaces created using a prebuild

If the `devcontainer.json` configuration file for a prebuild configuration specifies that permissions for access to other repositories are required, then the repository administrator is prompted to authorize these permissions when they create or update the prebuild configuration. If the administrator does not grant all of the requested permissions there's a chance that problems may occur in the prebuild, and in codespaces created from this prebuild. This is true even if the user who creates a codespace based on this prebuild _does_ grant all of the permissions when they are prompted to do so.

## Troubleshooting failed workflow runs for prebuilds

### Increasing the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} spending limit

Prebuilds are created and updated using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Your prebuild workflows will fail if you have used all of your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} minutes and have reached your spending limit. If this occurs you can increase your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} spending limit to allow the workflows to run. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/managing-your-spending-limit-for-github-actions).

### Authorizing access permissions

If the `devcontainer.json` configuration file for a prebuild configuration is updated to specify that permissions for access to other repositories are required, and a repository administrator has not been prompted to authorize these permissions for the prebuild configuration, then the prebuild workflow may fail. Try updating the prebuild configuration, without making any changes. If, when you click **Update**, the authorization page is displayed, check that the requested permissions are appropriate and, if so, authorize the request. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/managing-prebuilds#editing-a-prebuild-configuration) and [AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-repository-access-for-your-codespaces#setting-additional-repository-permissions).

If the workflow runs for a prebuild configuration are failing, you can temporarily disable the prebuild configuration while you investigate. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/managing-prebuilds#disabling-a-prebuild-configuration).

### Preventing out-of-date prebuilds being used

By default, if the latest prebuild workflow has failed, then a previous prebuild for the same combination of repository, branch, and `devcontainer.json` configuration file will be used to create new codespaces. This behavior is called prebuild optimization.

We recommend keeping prebuild optimization enabled, because it helps ensure that codespaces can still be created quickly if an up-to-date prebuild is not available. However, as a repository administrator, you can disable prebuild optimization if you run into problems with prebuilt codespaces being behind the current state of the branch. If you disable prebuild optimization, codespaces for the relevant combination of repository, branch, and `devcontainer.json` file will be created without a prebuild if the latest prebuild workflow has failed or is currently running.

## About forks

A fork is an independent copy of a repository. It lets you experiment without affecting the original and propose changes via pull requests.

The upstream repository appears below the forkâ€™s name on {% data variables.product.github %}.

## How forks differ from branches

Each fork has:

* Its own branches
* Discussions and members
* Issues and pull requests
* Actions and projects
* Tags, labels, and wikis

## When to use a fork

Use a fork to:

* Experiment safely
* Hold separate discussions
* Make your work independent

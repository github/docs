## About forks

{% data reusables.repositories.about-forks %} A fork can exist in either a personal account or an organization.

When you view a forked repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the upstream repository is indicated below the name of the fork.

![Screenshot of a repository's page on GitHub. Below the name of the repository, "mona/docs", the text "forked from github/docs" is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/fork-path.png)

In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before incorporating the changes into the upstream repository. {% data reusables.repositories.about-giving-access-to-forks %}

Deleting a fork will not delete the original upstream repository. Code pushed to a fork will be visible from the upstream, but changes won't have any immediate effect on the upstream branches. For example, you can add collaborators, rename files, or generate {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} on the fork without affecting the upstream branches. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %} After a fork is deleted, you cannot restore the fork. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/restoring-a-deleted-repository)."{% endif %} If you delete a private repository, all forks of the repository are deleted.

## About creating forks

For instructions for forking a repository, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)." For more information about when you can create forks, and the permission and visibility settings of forks, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks)."

## Forking a repository versus duplicating a repository

If you want to create a new repository from the contents of an existing repository but don't want to merge your changes to the upstream in the future, you can duplicate the repository or, if the repository is a template, you can use the repository as a template. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)".

Forking a repository is similar to duplicating a repository, with the following differences.

* Code pushed to a fork is visible to all repositories in the fork network, even after that fork is deleted.
* You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your fork to the upstream repository.
* You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.
* Forks have their own members, branches, tags, labels, policies, issues, pull requests, discussions, actions, projects, and wikis.
* Forks inherit the restrictions of their upstream repositories. For example, branch protection rules cannot be passed down if the upstream repository belongs to an organization on a {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} plan.

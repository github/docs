Repositories belong to a personal account (a single individual owner) or an organization account (a shared account with numerous collaborators or maintainers). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)." Owners and collaborators on a repository owned by a personal account can assign pull request reviews. Organization members with triage permissions can also assign a reviewer for a pull request.

To assign a reviewer to a pull request, you will need write access to the repository. For more information about repository access, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization)." If you have write access, you can assign anyone who has read access to the repository as a reviewer.

Organization members with write access can also assign a pull request review to any person or team with read access to a repository. The requested reviewer or team will receive a notification that you asked them to review the pull request. If you request a review from a team and code review assignment is enabled, specific members will be requested and the team will be removed as a reviewer. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team)."

{% note %}

**Note:** Pull request authors can't request reviews unless they are either a repository owner or collaborator with write access to the repository.

{% endnote %}

You can request a review from either a suggested or specific person. Suggested reviewers are based on [git blame data](/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file). If you request a review, other people with read access to the repository can still review your pull request. Once someone has reviewed your pull request and you've made the necessary changes, you can re-request review from the same reviewer. If the requested reviewer does not submit a review, and the pull request meets the repository's [mergeability requirements](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests), you can still merge the pull request.

   If you know the name of the person or team you'd like a review from, type the username of the person or the name of the team you're asking to review your changes. Click their team name or username to request a review.

1. After your pull request is reviewed and you've made the necessary changes, you can ask a reviewer to re-review your pull request. Navigate to **Reviewers** in the right sidebar and click {% octicon "sync" aria-label="Re-request review" %} next to the reviewer's name whose review you'd like.

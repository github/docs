## About dependency review

{% data reusables.dependency-review.feature-overview %}

{% ifversion ghec %}Before you can use dependency review in a private repository, you must enable the dependency graph. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#enabling-and-disabling-the-dependency-graph-for-a-private-repository).{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes %}Before you can use dependency review, you must enable the dependency graph and connect {% data variables.location.product_location %} to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-dependabot-for-your-enterprise).{% endif %}

Dependency review allows you to "shift left". You can use the provided predictive information to catch vulnerable dependencies before they hit production. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review).

You can use the {% data variables.dependency-review.action_name %} to help enforce dependency reviews on pull requests in your repository. {% data reusables.dependency-review.dependency-review-action-overview %}

You can configure the {% data variables.dependency-review.action_name %} to better suit your needs by specifying the type of dependency vulnerability you wish to catch. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/configuring-the-dependency-review-action).

## Reviewing dependencies in a pull request

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %}
{% data reusables.repositories.choose-pr-review %}
{% data reusables.repositories.changed-files %}

1. If the pull request contains many files, use the **File filter** drop-down menu to collapse all files that don't record dependencies. This will make it easier to focus your review on the dependency changes.

   ![Screenshot of the "Changed files" tab. A dropdown labeled "File filter" is expanded, displaying a list of file types with checkboxes.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/file-filter-menu-json.png)
   The dependency review provides a clearer view of what has changed in large lock files, where the source diff is not rendered by default.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Dependency review rich diffs are not available for committed static JavaScript files like `jquery.js`.

1. On the right of the header for a manifest or lock file, display the dependency review by clicking **{% octicon "file" aria-label="Display the rich diff" %}**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Files changed" tab of a pull request. The button to display the rich diff, labeled with a file icon, is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/dependency-review-rich-diff.png)

1. Check the dependencies listed in the dependency review.

   ![Screenshot of the vulnerability warnings in a dependency review for a pull request.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/dependency-review-vulnerability.png)

   Any added or changed dependencies that have vulnerabilities are listed first, ordered by severity and then by dependency name. This means that the highest severity dependencies are always at the top of a dependency review. Other dependencies are listed alphabetically by dependency name.

   The icon beside each dependency indicates whether the dependency has been added (<span style="color:#22863a">{% octicon "diff-added" aria-label="Dependency added icon" %}</span>), updated (<span style="color:#b08800">{% octicon "diff-modified" aria-label="Dependency modified icon" %}</span>), or removed (<span style="color:#cb2431">{% octicon "diff-removed" aria-label="Dependency removed icon" %}</span>) in this pull request.

   Other information includes:

   * The version, or version range, of the new, updated, or deleted dependency.
   * For a specific version of a dependency:
      * The age of that release of the dependency.
      * The number of projects that are dependent on this software. This information is taken from the dependency graph. Checking the number of dependents can help you avoid accidentally adding the wrong dependency.
      * The license used by this dependency, if this information is available. This is useful if you want to avoid code with certain licenses being used in your project.

   Where a dependency has a known vulnerability, the warning message includes:

   * A brief description of the vulnerability.
   * A Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or {% data variables.product.prodname_security_advisories %} (GHSA) identification number. You can click this ID to find out more about the vulnerability.
   * The severity of the vulnerability.
   * The version of the dependency in which the vulnerability was fixed. If you are reviewing a pull request for someone, you might ask the contributor to update the dependency to the patched version, or a later release.

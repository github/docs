To create commits on behalf of an organization:

* You must be a member of the organization indicated in the trailer
* You must sign the commit
* Your commit email and the organization email must be in a domain verified by the organization
* Your commit message must end with the commit trailer `on-behalf-of: @org <name@organization.com>`
  * `org` is the organization's login
  * `name@organization.com` is in the organization's domain

Organizations can use the `name@organization.com` email as a public point of contact for open source efforts.

## Creating commits with an `on-behalf-of` badge on the command line

1. Type your commit message and a short, meaningful description of your changes. After your commit description, instead of a closing quotation, add two empty lines.

   ```shell
   $ git commit -m "Refactor usability tests.
   >
   >
   ```

   {% tip %}

   **Tip:** If you're using a text editor on the command line to type your commit message, ensure there are two newlines between the end of your commit description and the `on-behalf-of:` commit trailer.

   {% endtip %}

1. On the next line of the commit message, type `on-behalf-of: @org <name@organization.com>`, then a closing quotation mark.

   ```shell
   $ git commit -m "Refactor usability tests.
   >
   >
   on-behalf-of: @ORG NAME@ORGANIZATION.COM"
   ```

The new commit, message, and badge will appear on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} the next time you push. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)."

## Creating commits with an `on-behalf-of` badge on {% data variables.product.product_name %}

1. Click **Commit changes...**
1. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made.
1. In the text box below your commit message, add `on-behalf-of: @org <name@organization.com>`.
1. Click **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.

The new commit, message, and badge will appear on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

Task lists render with clickable checkboxes in comments. You can select or unselect the checkboxes to mark them as complete or incomplete.

Task lists render as read-only checkboxes in Markdown files. People with write permissions in the repository can edit the file to select or unselect the checkboxes.

You can view task list summary information in issue and pull request lists, when the task list is in the initial comment.

### Reordering tasks

You can reorder task lists within a single comment by clicking to the left of a task's checkbox, dragging it to a new location, and dropping it. If you have multiple lists within a comment, you can reorder tasks across the single comment. You can't add or reorder tasks across different comments.

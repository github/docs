### {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s release cycle

{% data variables.product.product_name %}'s products and features can go through multiple release phases.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Alpha | The product or feature is under heavy development and often has changing requirements and scope. The feature is available for demonstration and test purposes but may not be documented. Alpha releases are not necessarily feature complete, no service level agreements (SLAs) are provided, and there are no technical support obligations. |
| Beta | The product or feature is ready for broader distribution. Beta releases can be public or private, are documented, but do not have any SLAs or technical support obligations. |
| General availability (GA) | The product or feature is fully tested and open publicly to all users. GA releases are ready for production use, and associated SLA and technical support obligations apply. |

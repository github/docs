### GitHub's Notice to California Residents

The [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375) of 2018, (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., as amended, “CCPA”) gives California residents rights and control over their personal information. GitHub, Inc. ("GitHub", "we") provides this statement to those residents ("you") in accordance with requirements under the CCPA to make certain disclosures about the collection and processing of their personal information. This is GitHub’s California-specific description of consumers’ privacy rights under the CCPA. For information about how we’ve extended the CCPA core rights to control personal information to all of our users in the United States, please see our [Privacy Statement](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

### We do not sell your personal information

Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents' personal information to others: 1) must give notice to California residents before selling their personal information to others; and 2) must provide the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.

GitHub _does not_ sell personal information, including personal information of anyone under 16 years old. Thus, these notification and opt-out requirements do not apply to GitHub.

## Your rights under the CCPA

The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to their personal information. To submit a request based on these rights, please contact us via our [contact form](https://support.github.com/contact).

When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the request is the resident to whom the personal information subject to the request pertains. California residents may exercise their rights themselves or may use an authorized agent to make requests to disclose certain information about the processing of their personal information or to delete personal information on their behalf. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we may require that you provide us additional information demonstrating that the agent is acting on your behalf.

With respect to their personal information, California residents may exercise the rights described below.

### 1. Right to know what personal information is being collected, for what purposes and with whom it is shared

California residents have the right to request from a business disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information it has collected from them in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources from which such personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling such personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information.

If you request that a business disclose categories and specific pieces of personal information collected about you, you have the right to receive that information, free of charge, twice a year. The information may be delivered by mail or electronically and, if provided electronically, shall be in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the California resident to relatively easily transmit this information to another entity. You can use GitHub’s [User Migration API](/rest/reference/migrations#users) to access and download your data. Learn more [here](https://github.blog/2018-12-19-download-your-data/).

### 2. Right to know whether your personal information is sold or disclosed for a business purpose and to whom

California residents have the right to request from a business that sells or discloses personal information for a business purpose separate lists of the categories of personal information collected, sold or disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months, including the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.

### 3. Right to say no to the sale of your personal information

As explained above, the CCPA requires businesses that sell personal information to allow residents the ability to opt out of the selling of their information.

Again, GitHub does not sell personal information.

### 4. Right to non-discrimination of service or price if you exercise your privacy rights

The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against a California resident for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA, including by
- denying goods or services
- charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or by imposing penalties
- providing a different level or quality of goods or services
- suggesting that the person exercising their rights will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services

### 5. Right to deletion

California residents have the right to request that a business delete any of their personal information that the business collected from them, subject to the exceptions in CCPA §1798.105.

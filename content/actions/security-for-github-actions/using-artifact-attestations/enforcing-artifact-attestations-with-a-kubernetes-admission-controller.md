## About Kubernetes admission controller

[Artifact attestations](/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) enable you to create unfalsifiable provenance and integrity guarantees for the software you build. In turn, people who consume your software can verify where and how your software was built.

Kubernetes admission controllers are plugins that govern the behavior of the Kubernetes API server. They are commonly used to enforce security policies and best practices in a Kubernetes cluster.

Using the open source [Sigstore Policy Controller](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/) project you can add an admission controller to your Kubernetes cluster that can enforce artifact attestations. This way, you can ensure that only artifacts with valid attestations can be deployed.

To [install the controller](#getting-started-with-kubernetes-admission-controller), we offer [two Helm charts](https://github.com/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts): one for deploying the Sigstore Policy Controller, and another for loading the GitHub trust root and a default policy.

### About trust roots and policies

The Sigstore Policy Controller is primarily configured with trust roots and policies, represented by the Custom Resources `TrustRoot` and `ClusterImagePolicy`. A `TrustRoot` represents a trusted distribution channel for the public key material used to verify attestations. A `ClusterImagePolicy` represents a policy for enforcing attestations on images.

A `TrustRoot` may also contain a [TUF](https://theupdateframework.io/) repository root, making it possible for your cluster to continuously and securely receive updates to its trusted public key material. If left unspecified, a `ClusterImagePolicy` will by default use the open source Sigstore Public Good Instance's key material. When verifying attestations generated for private repositories, the `ClusterImagePolicy` must reference the GitHub `TrustRoot`.

## Getting started with Kubernetes admission controller

To set up an admission controller for enforcing GitHub artifact attestations, you need to:

1. [Deploy the Sigstore Policy Controller](#deploy-the-sigstore-policy-controller).
1. [Add the GitHub `TrustRoot` and a `ClusterImagePolicy` to your cluster](#add-the-github-trustroot-and-a-clusterimagepolicy).
1. [Enable the policy in your namespace](#enable-the-policy-in-your-namespace).

### Deploy the Sigstore Policy Controller

We have packaged the Sigstore Policy Controller as a [GitHub distributed Helm chart](https://github.com/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts). Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* A Kubernetes cluster with version 1.27 or later
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 3.0 or later
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

First, install the Helm chart that deploys the Sigstore Policy Controller:

```bash copy
helm upgrade policy-controller --install --atomic \
  --create-namespace --namespace artifact-attestations \
  oci://ghcr.io/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts/policy-controller \
  --version v0.10.0-github8
```

This installs the Policy Controller into the `artifact-attestations` namespace. At this point, no policies have been configured, and it will not enforce any attestations.

### Add the GitHub `TrustRoot` and a `ClusterImagePolicy`

Once the policy controller has been deployed, you need to add the GitHub `TrustRoot` and a `ClusterImagePolicy` to your cluster. Use the Helm chart we provide to do this. Make sure to replace `MY-ORGANIZATION` with your GitHub organization's name (e.g., `github` or `octocat-inc`).

```bash copy
helm upgrade trust-policies --install --atomic \
 --namespace artifact-attestations \
 oci://ghcr.io/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts/trust-policies \
 --version v0.6.1 \
 --set policy.enabled=true \
 --set policy.organization=MY-ORGANIZATION
```

You've now installed the GitHub trust root, and an artifact attestation policy into your cluster. This policy will reject artifacts that have not originated from within your GitHub organization.

### Enable the policy in your namespace

> [!WARNING]
> This policy will not be enforced until you specify which namespaces it should apply to.

Each namespace in your cluster can independently enforce policies. To enable enforcement in a namespace, you can add the following label to the namespace:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    policy.sigstore.dev/include: "true"
```

After the label is added, the GitHub artifact attestation policy will be enforced in the namespace.

Alternatively, you may run:

```bash copy
kubectl label namespace MY-NAMESPACE policy.sigstore.dev/include=true
```

### Matching images

By default, the policy installed with the `trust-policies` Helm chart will verify attestations for all images before admitting them into the cluster. If you only intend to enforce attestations for a subset of images, you can use the Helm values `policy.images` and `policy.exemptImages` to specify a list of images to match against. These values can be set to a list of glob patterns that match the image names. The globbing syntax uses Go [filepath](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) semantics, with the addition of `**` to match any character sequence, including slashes.

For example, to enforce attestations for images that match the pattern `ghcr.io/MY-ORGANIZATION/*` and admit `busybox` without a valid attestation, you can run:

```bash copy
helm upgrade trust-policies --install --atomic \
 --namespace artifact-attestations \
 oci://ghcr.io/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts/trust-policies \
 --version v0.6.1 \
 --set policy.enabled=true \
 --set policy.organization=MY-ORGANIZATION \
 --set-json 'policy.exemptImages=["index.docker.io/library/busybox**"]' \
 --set-json 'policy.images=["ghcr.io/MY-ORGANIZATION/**"]'
 ```

All patterns must use the fully-qualified name, even if the images originate from Docker Hub. In this example, if we want to exempt the image `busybox`, we must provide the full name including the domain and double-star glob to match all image versions: `index.docker.io/library/busybox**`.

Note that any image you intend to admit _must_ have a matching glob pattern in the `policy.images` list. If an image does not match any pattern, it will be rejected. Additionally, if an image matches both `policy.images` and `policy.exemptImages`, it will be rejected.

{% ifversion ghec %}

If your GitHub Enterprise account has a subdomain on GHE.com, you must specify a value for the GitHub trust domain. This value is used to fetch the trusted materials associated with the data residency region that hosts your GitHub Enterprise account. This value can be found by logging into your enterprise account with the `gh` CLI tool and running the following command:

```bash copy
gh api meta --jq .domains.artifact_attestations.trust_domain
```

This value must be added when installing the `trust-policies` chart, like so:

```bash copy
--set-json 'policy.trust.githubTrustDomain="YOUR-GHEC-TRUST-DOMAIN"'
```

{% endif %}

### Advanced usage

To see the full set of options you may configure with the Helm chart, you can run either of the following commands.
For policy controller options:

```bash copy
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts/policy-controller --version v0.10.0-github8
```

For trust policy options:

```bash copy
helm show values oci://ghcr.io/github/artifact-attestations-helm-charts/trust-policies --version v0.6.1
```

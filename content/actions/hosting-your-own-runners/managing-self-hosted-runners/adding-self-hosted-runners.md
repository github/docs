{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

You can add a self-hosted runner to a repository, an organization, or an enterprise.

If you are an organization or enterprise administrator, you might want to add your self-hosted runners at the organization or enterprise level. This approach makes the runner available to multiple repositories in your organization or enterprise, and also lets you to manage your runners in one place.

For information on supported operating systems for self-hosted runners, or using self-hosted runners with a proxy server, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)."

**Warning:** {% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security-with-public-repositories)."

{% endwarning %}

You can set up automation to scale the number of self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners)."

{% ifversion actions-single-use-tokens %}

You can register ephemeral runners that perform a single job before the registration is cleaned up by using just-in-time runner registration. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners)."

## Prerequisites

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runners-prerequisites %}

## Adding a self-hosted runner to a repository

You can add self-hosted runners to a single repository. To add a self-hosted runner to a user repository, you must be the repository owner. For an organization repository, {% ifversion custom-org-roles %}you must be an organization owner, have admin access to the repository, or have the “Manage organization runners and runner groups” permission.{% else %}you must be an organization owner or have admin access to the repository.{% endif %}

{% ifversion custom-org-roles %}For more information about custom organization roles, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-organization-roles)."{% endif %}

For information about how to add a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners)."

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an organization

You can add self-hosted runners at the organization level, where they can be used to process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization. To add a self-hosted runner to an organization, you must be an organization owner{% ifversion custom-org-roles %} or have the "Manage organization runners and runner groups" permission{% endif %}. For information about how to add a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners)."

## Adding a self-hosted runner to an enterprise

{% ifversion fpt %}If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you{% elsif ghec or ghes %}You{% endif %} can add self-hosted runners to an enterprise, where they can be assigned to multiple organizations. The organization owner can control which repositories can use it. {% ifversion fpt %}For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-enterprise).{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}
New runners are assigned to the default group. You can modify the runner's group after you've registered the runner. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#moving-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-group)."

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}

To add a self-hosted runner to an enterprise, you must be an enterprise owner. For information about how to add a self-hosted runner with the REST API,  see the enterprise endpoints in the [{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} REST API](/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners).

### Making enterprise runners available to repositories

By default, runners in an enterprise's "Default" self-hosted runner group are available to all organizations in the enterprise, but are not available to all repositories in each organization.

To make an enterprise-level self-hosted runner group available to an organization repository, you might need to change the organization's inherited settings for the runner group to make the runner available to repositories in the organization.

For more information on changing runner group access settings, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-the-access-policy-of-a-self-hosted-runner-group)."

## About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_runner_controller %}

{% data reusables.actions.actions-runner-controller-about-arc %}

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of ARC's autoscaling runner scaleset mode.

{% note %}

**Note:** To view the following diagram in a larger size, see the [Autoscaling Runner Scale Sets mode](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/gha-runner-scale-set-controller/README.md#how-it-works) documentation in the Actions Runner Controller repository.

<!-- The numbers in the ordered list below correspond to numbers in the above diagram, which is why we use explicit numbering here. -->

1. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_runner_controller %} is installed using the supplied Helm charts, and the controller manager pod is deployed in the specified namespace. A new AutoScalingRunnerSet resource is deployed via the supplied Helm charts or a customized manifest file. The AutoScalingRunnerSet Controller calls GitHub's APIs to fetch the runner group ID that the runner scale set will belong to.
1. The AutoScalingRunnerSet Controller calls the APIs one more time to either fetch or create a runner scale set in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} service before creating the Runner ScaleSet Listener resource.
1. A Runner ScaleSet Listener pod is deployed by the AutoScalingListener Controller. In this pod, the listener application connects to the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service to authenticate and establish an HTTPS long poll connection. The listener stays idle until it receives a `Job Available` message from the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service.
1. When a workflow run is triggered from a repository, the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service dispatches individual job runs to the runners or runner scalesets where the `runs-on` key matches the name of the runner scaleset or labels of self-hosted runners.
1. When the Runner ScaleSet Listener receives the `Job Available` message, it checks whether it can scale up to the desired count. If it can, the Runner ScaleSet Listener acknowledges the message.
1. The Runner ScaleSet Listener uses a Service Account and a Role bound to that account to make an HTTPS call through the Kubernetes APIs to patch the Ephemeral RunnerSet resource with the number of desired replicas count.
1. The Ephemeral RunnerSet attempts to create new runners and the EphemeralRunner Controller requests a Just-in-Time (JIT) configuration token to register these runners. The controller attempts to create runner pods. If the pod's status is `failed`, the controller retries up to 5 times. After 24 hours the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service unassigns the job if no runner accepts it.
1. Once the runner pod is created, the runner application in the pod uses the JIT configuration token to register itself with the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service. It then establishes another HTTPS long poll connection to receive the job details it needs to execute.
1. The {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service acknowledges the runner registration and dispatches the job run details.
1. Throughout the job run execution, the runner continuously communicates the logs and job run status back to the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service.
1. When the runner completes its job successfully, the EphemeralRunner Controller checks with the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} Service to see if runner can be deleted. If it can, the Ephemeral RunnerSet deletes the runner.

## {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_runner_controller %} components

ARC consists of a set of resources, some of which are created specifically for ARC. An ARC deployment applies these resources onto a Kubernetes cluster. Once applied, it creates a set of Pods that contain your self-hosted runners' containers. With ARC, {% data variables.product.company_short %} can treat these runner containers as self-hosted runners and allocate jobs to them as needed.

Each resource that is deployed by ARC is given a name composed of:

* an installation name, which is the installation name you specify when you install the Helm chart.
* a resource identification suffix, which is a string that identifies the resource type. This value is not configurable.

{% note %}

**Note:** Different versions of Kubernetes have different length limits for names of resources. The length limit for the resource name is calculated by adding the length of the installation name and the length of the resource identification suffix. If the resource name is longer than the reserved length, you will receive an error.

### About custom resources

ARC consists of several custom resource definitions (CRDs). For more information on custom resources, see [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in the Kubernetes documentation. You can find the list of custom resource definitions used for ARC in the following API schema definitions.

* [actions.github.com/v1alpha1](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/apis/actions.github.com/v1alpha1)
* [actions.summerwind.net/v1alpha1](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/apis/actions.summerwind.net/v1alpha1)

Because custom resources are extensions of the Kubernetes API, they won't be available in a default Kubernetes installation. You will need to install these custom resources to use ARC. For more information on installing custom resources, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller)."

Once the custom resources are installed, you can deploy ARC into your Kubernetes cluster. For information about deploying ARC, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller)."

### About the runner container image

{% data variables.product.company_short %} maintains a [minimal runner container image](https://github.com/actions/runner/pkgs/container/actions-runner). A new image will be published with every runner binaries release. The most recent image will have the runner binaries version and `latest` as tags.

This image contains the least amount of packages necessary for the container runtime and the runner binaries. To install additional software, you can create your own runner image. You can use ARC's runner image as a base, or use the corresponding setup actions. For instance, `actions/setup-java` for Java or `actions/setup-node` for Node.

You can find the definition of ARC's runner image in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/main/images/Dockerfile) and the definition of the base image in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/src/runtime-deps/6.0/bullseye-slim/amd64/Dockerfile).

#### Creating your own runner image

You can create your own runner image that meets your requirements. Your runner image must fulfill the following conditions.

* Use a base image that can run the self-hosted runner application. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)."
* The [runner binary](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases) must be placed under `/home/runner/` and launched using `/home/runner/run.sh`.
* If you use Kubernetes mode, the [runner container hooks](https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks/releases) must be placed under `/home/runner/k8s`.

You can use the following example Dockerfile to start creating your own runner image.

```dockerfile copy
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0 as build

# Replace value with the latest runner release version
# source: https://github.com/actions/runner/releases
# ex: 2.303.0
ARG RUNNER_VERSION=""
ARG RUNNER_ARCH="x64"
# Replace value with the latest runner-container-hooks release version
# source: https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks/releases
# ex: 0.3.1
ARG RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS_VERSION=""

    && rm runner-container-hooks.zip

USER runner
```

## Executing workflows

After installation and configuration are complete, you can use ARC to execute workflow runs. A workflow can be created in the same repository that can target a self hosted runner created by ARC. For more information about targeting workflows to run on self-hosted runners, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)."

### Using ARC runners in a workflow

{% data reusables.actions.actions-runner-controller-labels %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/using-actions-runner-controller-runners-in-a-workflow)."

## Scaling runners

You can scale runners statically or dynamically depending on your needs. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller#scaling-runners)."

## Software installed in the ARC runner image

The ARC [runner image](https://github.com/actions/runner/pkgs/container/actions-runner) is bundled with the following software:

* [Runner binaries](https://github.com/actions/runner)
* [Runner container hooks](https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks)
* Docker (required for Docker-in-Docker mode)

For more information, see [ARC's runner image Dockerfile](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/main/images/Dockerfile) in the Actions repository.

## Assets and releases

ARC is released as two Helm charts and one container image. The Helm charts are only published as Open Container Initiative (OCI) packages. ARC does not provide tarballs or Helm repositories via {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %}.

You can find the latest releases of ARC's Helm charts and container image on {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}:

* [`gha-runner-scale-set-controller` Helm chart](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/pkgs/container/actions-runner-controller-charts%2Fgha-runner-scale-set-controller)
* [`gha-runner-scale-set` Helm chart](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/pkgs/container/actions-runner-controller-charts%2Fgha-runner-scale-set)
* [`gha-runner-scale-set-controller` container image](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/pkgs/container/gha-runner-scale-set-controller)

The supported runner image is released as a separate container image, which you can find at [`actions-runner`](https://github.com/actions/runner/pkgs/container/actions-runner) on {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.

## Overview

OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows to access resources in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), without needing to store the GCP credentials as long-lived {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} secrets.

This guide gives an overview of how to configure GCP to trust {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s OIDC as a federated identity, and includes a workflow example for the [`google-github-actions/auth`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) action that uses tokens to authenticate to GCP and access resources.

## Adding a Google Cloud Workload Identity Provider

To configure the OIDC identity provider in GCP, you will need to perform the following configuration. For instructions on making these changes, refer to [the GCP documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth).

1. Create a new identity pool.
1. Configure the mapping and add conditions.
1. Connect the new pool to a service account.

Additional guidance for configuring the identity provider:

- For security hardening, make sure you've reviewed "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#configuring-the-oidc-trust-with-the-cloud)." For an example, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#configuring-the-subject-in-your-cloud-provider)."
- For the service account to be available for configuration, it needs to be assigned to the `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` role. For more information, see [the GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation?_ga=2.114275588.-285296507.1634918453#conditions).
- The Issuer URL to use: {% ifversion ghes %}`https://HOSTNAME/_services/token`{% else %}`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`{% endif %}

## Updating your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow

To update your workflows for OIDC, you will need to make two changes to your YAML:
1. Add permissions settings for the token.
1. Use the [`google-github-actions/auth`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) action to exchange the OIDC token (JWT) for a cloud access token.

### Adding permissions settings

 {% data reusables.actions.oidc-permissions-token %}

### Requesting the access token

The `google-github-actions/auth` action receives a JWT from the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC provider, and then requests an access token from GCP. For more information, see the GCP [documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth).

This example has a job called `Get_OIDC_ID_token` that uses actions to request a list of services from GCP.

- `<example-workload-identity-provider>`: Replace this with the path to your identity provider in GCP. For example, `projects/<example-project-id>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<name-of-pool/providers/<name-of-provider>`
- `<example-service-account>`: Replace this with the name of your service account in GCP.
- `<project-id>`: Replace this with the ID of your GCP project.

This action exchanges a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} OIDC token for a Google Cloud access token, using [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).

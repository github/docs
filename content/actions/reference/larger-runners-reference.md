## Networking for {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %}

By default, {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} receive a dynamic IP address that changes for each job run. Optionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} customers can configure their {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} to receive static IP addresses from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s IP address pool. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-githubs-ip-addresses).

When enabled, instances of the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runner %} will receive IP addresses from specific ranges that are unique to the runner, allowing you to use the ranges to configure a firewall allowlist. {% ifversion fpt %}You can use up to 10 {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} with static IP address ranges in total across all your {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %}{% endif %}{% ifversion ghec %}You can use up to 10 {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} with static IP address ranges for the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} created at the enterprise level. In addition, you can use up to 10 {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} with static IP address ranges for the {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %} created at the organization level, for each organization in your enterprise{% endif %}.

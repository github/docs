## Naming your secrets

>[!TIP]
> To help ensure that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} redacts your secrets in logs correctly, avoid using structured data as the values of secrets.

The following rules apply to secret names:

{% data reusables.actions.actions-secrets-and-variables-naming %}

{% data reusables.codespaces.secret-precedence %} Similarly, if an organization, repository, and environment all have a secret with the same name, the environment-level secret takes precedence.

## Limits for secrets

You can store up to 1,000 organization secrets, 100 repository secrets, and 100 environment secrets.

A workflow created in a repository can access the following number of secrets:

* All 100 repository secrets.
* If the repository is assigned access to more than 100 organization secrets, the workflow can only use the first 100 organization secrets (sorted alphabetically by secret name).
* All 100 environment secrets.

Secrets are limited to 48 KB in size. To store larger secrets, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#storing-large-secrets).

## When {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} reads secrets

Organization and repository secrets are read when a workflow run is queued, and environment secrets are read when a job referencing the environment starts.

## Automatically redacted secrets

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically redacts the following sensitive information from workflow logs.

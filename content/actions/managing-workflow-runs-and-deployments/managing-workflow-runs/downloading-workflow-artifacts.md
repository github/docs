By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} stores build logs and artifacts for 90 days, and you can customize this retention period, depending on the type of repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-repository)."

{% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} will download each artifact into separate directories based on the artifact name. If only a single artifact is specified, it will be extracted into the current directory.

To download all artifacts generated by a workflow run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID
```

To download a specific artifact from a run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. Replace `artifact-name` with the name of the artifact that you want to download.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID -n ARTIFACT_NAME
```

You can specify more than one artifact.

```shell
gh run download RUN_ID> -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 -n ARTIFACT_NAME-2
```

To download specific artifacts across all runs in a repository, use the `run download` subcommand.

```shell
gh run download -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 ARTIFACT_NAME-2
```

{% endcli %}

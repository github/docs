## About re-running workflows and jobs

Re-running a workflow{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} or jobs in a workflow{% endif %} uses the same `GITHUB_SHA` (commit SHA) and `GITHUB_REF` (Git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run. The workflow will use the privileges of the actor who initially triggered the workflow, not the privileges of the actor who initiated the re-run. You can re-run a workflow{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} or jobs in a workflow{% endif %} for up to 30 days after the initial run.{% ifversion re-run-jobs %} You cannot re-run jobs in a workflow once its logs have passed their retention limits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy)."{% endif %}{% ifversion debug-reruns %} When you re-run a workflow or jobs in a workflow, you can enable debug logging for the re-run. This will enable runner diagnostic logging and step debug logging for the re-run. For more information about debug logging, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging)."{% endif %}

## Re-running all the jobs in a workflow

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, re-run jobs.

   * If any jobs failed, select the **{% octicon "sync" aria-hidden="true" %} Re-run jobs** dropdown menu and click **Re-run all jobs**.

   * If no jobs failed, click **Re-run all jobs**.

{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To re-run a failed workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the failed run that you want to re-run.  If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --debug
```

{% endif %}

To view the progress of the workflow run, use the `run watch` subcommand and select the run from the interactive list.

```shell
gh run watch
```

{% endcli %}

{% ifversion re-run-jobs %}

## Re-running failed jobs in a workflow

If any jobs in a workflow run failed, you can re-run just the jobs that failed. When you re-run failed jobs in a workflow, a new workflow run will start for all failed jobs and their dependents. Any outputs for any successful jobs in the previous workflow run will be used for the re-run. Any artifacts that were created in the initial run will be available in the re-run. Any deployment protection rules that passed in the previous run will automatically pass in the re-run.

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the workflow, select the **{% octicon "sync" aria-hidden="true" %} Re-run jobs** dropdown menu, and click **Re-run failed jobs**.
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

To re-run failed jobs in a workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand with the `--failed` flag. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run for which you want to re-run failed jobs. If you don't specify a `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent failed run.

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed --debug
```

{% endif %}
{% endcli %}

## Re-running a specific job in a workflow

When you re-run a specific job in a workflow, a new workflow run will start for the job and any dependents. Any outputs for any other jobs in the previous workflow run will be used for the re-run. Any artifacts that were created in the initial run will be available in the re-run. Any deployment protection rules that passed in the previous run will automatically pass in the re-run.

{% webui %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. Under the "Jobs" section of the left sidebar, next to the job that you want to re-run, click {% octicon "sync" aria-label="The re-run icon" %}.

{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging %}

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

To re-run a specific job in a workflow run, use the `run rerun` subcommand with the `--job` flag. Replace `job-id` with the ID of the job that you want to re-run.

```shell
gh run rerun --job JOB_ID
```

{% ifversion debug-reruns %}
{% data reusables.actions.enable-debug-logging-cli %}

```shell
gh run rerun --job JOB_ID --debug
```

{% endif %}
{% endcli %}

{% endif %}

## Reviewing previous workflow runs

You can view the results from your previous attempts at running a workflow. You can also view previous workflow runs using the API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-a-workflow-run)."

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
{%- ifversion re-run-jobs %}
1. To the right of the run name, select the **Latest** dropdown menu and click a previous run attempt.
{%- else %}
1. In the left pane, click a previous run attempt.
{%- endif %}

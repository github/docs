## Using a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner

To use a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner, create a job and use `runs-on` to specify the type of runner that will process the job, such as `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, or `macos-latest`. For the full list of runner types, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/reference/github-hosted-runners-reference#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources).{% ifversion repository-actions-runners %} If you have `repo: write` access to a repository, you can view a list of the runners available to use in workflows in the repository. For more information, see [Viewing available runners for a repository](#viewing-available-runners-for-a-repository).{% endif %}

When the job begins, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically provisions a new VM for that job. All steps in the job execute on the VM, allowing the steps in that job to share information using the runner's filesystem. You can run workflows directly on the VM or in a Docker container. When the job has finished, the VM is automatically decommissioned.

The following diagram demonstrates how two jobs in a workflow are executed on two different {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners.

![Diagram of a workflow that consists of two jobs. One job runs on Ubuntu and the other runs on Windows.](/assets/images/help/actions/overview-github-hosted-runner.png)

The following example workflow has two jobs, named `Run-npm-on-Ubuntu` and `Run-PSScriptAnalyzer-on-Windows`. When this workflow is triggered, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provisions a new virtual machine for each job.

* The job named `Run-npm-on-Ubuntu` is executed on a Linux VM, because the job's `runs-on:` specifies `ubuntu-latest`.
* The job named `Run-PSScriptAnalyzer-on-Windows` is executed on a Windows VM, because the job's `runs-on:` specifies `windows-latest`.

```yaml copy
name: Run commands on different operating systems
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  Run-npm-on-Ubuntu:
    name: Run npm on Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-setup-node %}
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm help

  Run-PSScriptAnalyzer-on-Windows:
    name: Run PSScriptAnalyzer on Windows
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
      - name: Install PSScriptAnalyzer module
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Set-PSRepository PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
          Install-Module PSScriptAnalyzer -ErrorAction Stop
      - name: Get list of rules
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule
```

While the job runs, the logs and output can be viewed in the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} UI:

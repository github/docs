## Prerequisites

Before you start generating artifact attestations, you need to understand what they are and when you should use them. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/concepts/security/artifact-attestations).

## Generating artifact attestations for your builds

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to generate artifact attestations that establish build provenance for artifacts such as binaries and container images.

To generate an artifact attestation, you must:

* Ensure you have the appropriate permissions configured in your workflow.
* Include a step in your workflow that uses the [`attest-build-provenance` action](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance).

When you run your updated workflows, they will build your artifacts and generate an artifact attestation that establishes build provenance. You can view attestations in your repository's **Actions** tab. For more information, see the [`attest-build-provenance`](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance) repository.

### Generating build provenance for binaries

1. In the workflow that builds the binary you would like to attest, add the following permissions.

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write
     contents: read
     attestations: write
   ```

1. After the step where the binary has been built, add the following step.

   ```yaml
   - name: Generate artifact attestation
     uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v2
     with:
       subject-path: 'PATH/TO/ARTIFACT'
   ```

   The value of the `subject-path` parameter should be set to the path to the binary you want to attest.

### Generating build provenance for container images

1. In the workflow that builds the container image you would like to attest, add the following permissions.

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write
     contents: read
     attestations: write
     packages: write
   ```

1. After the step where the image has been built, add the following step.

   ```yaml
   - name: Generate artifact attestation
     uses: actions/attest-build-provenance@v2
     with:
       subject-name: {% raw %}${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}{% endraw %}
       subject-digest: 'sha256:fedcba0...'
       push-to-registry: true
   ```

   The value of the `subject-name` parameter should specify the fully-qualified image name. For example, `ghcr.io/user/app` or `acme.azurecr.io/user/app`. Do not include a tag as part of the image name.

   The value of the `subject-digest` parameter should be set to the SHA256 digest of the subject for the attestation, in the form `sha256:HEX_DIGEST`. If your workflow uses `docker/build-push-action`, you can use the [`digest`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action?tab=readme-ov-file#outputs) output from that step to supply the value. For more information on using outputs, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs).

## Generating an attestation for a software bill of materials (SBOM)

You can generate signed SBOM attestations for workflow artifacts.

To generate an attestation for an SBOM, you must:

* Ensure you have the appropriate permissions configured in your workflow.
* Create an SBOM for your artifact. For more information, see [`anchore-sbom-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-sbom-action) in the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
* Include a step in your workflow that uses the [`attest-sbom` action](https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom).

When you run your updated workflows, they will build your artifacts and generate an SBOM attestation. You can view attestations in your repository's **Actions** tab. For more information, see the [`attest-sbom` action](https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom) repository.

### Generating an SBOM attestation for binaries

1. In the workflow that builds the binary you would like to attest, add the following permissions.

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write
     contents: read
     attestations: write
   ```

1. After the step where the binary has been built, add the following step.

   ```yaml
   - name: Generate SBOM attestation
     uses: actions/attest-sbom@v2
     with:
       subject-path: 'PATH/TO/ARTIFACT'
       sbom-path: 'PATH/TO/SBOM'
   ```

   The value of the `subject-path` parameter should be set to the path of the binary the SBOM describes. The value of the `sbom-path` parameter should be set to the path of the SBOM file you generated.

### Generating an SBOM attestation for container images

1. In the workflow that builds the container image you would like to attest, add the following permissions.

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write
     contents: read
     attestations: write
     packages: write
   ```

1. After the step where the image has been built, add the following step.

   ```yaml
   - name: Generate SBOM attestation
     uses: actions/attest-sbom@v2
     with:
       subject-name: {% raw %}${{ env.REGISTRY }}/PATH/TO/IMAGE{% endraw %}
       subject-digest: 'sha256:fedcba0...'
       sbom-path: 'sbom.json'
       push-to-registry: true
   ```

   The value of the `subject-name` parameter should specify the fully-qualified image name. For example, `ghcr.io/user/app` or `acme.azurecr.io/user/app`. Do not include a tag as part of the image name.

   The value of the `subject-digest` parameter should be set to the SHA256 digest of the subject for the attestation, in the form `sha256:HEX_DIGEST`. If your workflow uses `docker/build-push-action`, you can use the [`digest`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action?tab=readme-ov-file#outputs) output from that step to supply the value. For more information on using outputs, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs).

   The value of the `sbom-path` parameter should be set to the path to the JSON-formatted SBOM file you want to attest.

## Verifying artifact attestations with the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}

You can validate artifact attestations for binaries and container images and validate SBOM attestations using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see the [`attestation`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation) section of the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} manual.

>[!NOTE]These commands assume you are in an online environment. If you are in an offline or air-gapped environment, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/verifying-attestations-offline).

### Verifying an artifact attestation for binaries

To verify artifact attestations for **binaries**, use the following {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} command.

```bash copy
gh attestation verify PATH/TO/YOUR/BUILD/ARTIFACT-BINARY -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### Verifying an artifact attestation for container images

To verify artifact attestations for **container images**, you must provide the image's FQDN prefixed with `oci://` instead of the path to a binary. You can use the following {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} command.

```bash copy
docker login ghcr.io

gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ORGANIZATION_NAME/IMAGE_NAME:test -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### Verifying an attestation for SBOMs

To verify SBOM attestations, you have to provide the `--predicate-type` flag to reference a non-default predicate. For more information, see [Vetted predicates](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/tree/main/spec/predicates#vetted-predicates) in the `in-toto/attestation` repository.

For example, the [`attest-sbom` action](https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom) currently supports either SPDX or CycloneDX SBOM predicates. To verify an SBOM attestation in the SPDX format, you can use the following {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} command.

```bash copy
gh attestation verify PATH/TO/YOUR/BUILD/ARTIFACT-BINARY \
  -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3
```

To view more information on the attestation, reference the `--format json` flag. This can be especially helpful when reviewing SBOM attestations.

```bash copy
gh attestation verify PATH/TO/YOUR/BUILD/ARTIFACT-BINARY \
  -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3 \
  --format json \
  --jq '.[].verificationResult.statement.predicate'
```

## Next steps

To keep your attestations relevant and manageable, you should delete attestations that are no longer needed. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/managing-the-lifecycle-of-artifact-attestations).

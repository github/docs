## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, you should be generating artifact attestations for your builds. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).

## Step 1: Download attestation bundle

First, get the attestation bundle from the attestation API.

You can do so with the following command from a machine that is online:

```bash copy
gh attestation download PATH/TO/YOUR/BUILD/ARTIFACT-BINARY -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME
```

Here is example output from that command:

```bash
Wrote attestations to file sha256:ae57936def59bc4c75edd3a837d89bcefc6d3a5e31d55a6fa7a71624f92c3c3b.jsonl.
Any previous content has been overwritten

The trusted metadata is now available at sha256:ae57936def59bc4c75edd3a837d89bcefc6d3a5e31d55a6fa7a71624f92c3c3b.jsonl
```

## Step 2: Download trusted roots

Next, get the key material from the trusted roots.

Artifact attestations uses the Sigstore public good instance for public repositories, and GitHub's Sigstore instance for private repositories. You can use one command to get both trusted roots:

```bash copy
gh attestation trusted-root > trusted_root.jsonl
```

### Updating trusted root information in an offline environment

It's best practice to generate a new `trusted_root.jsonl` file any time you are importing new signed material into your offline environment.

The key material in `trusted_root.jsonl` does not have a built-in expiration date, so anything signed before you generate the trusted root file will continue to successfully verify. Anything signed after the file is generated will verify until that Sigstore instance rotates its key material, which typically happens a few times per year. You will not know if key material has been revoked since you last generated the trusted root file.

## Step 3: Perform offline verification

Now, you are ready to verify the artifact offline.

You should import into your offline environment:
* {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}
* Your artifact
* The bundle file
* The trusted root file

You can then perform offline verification with the following command:

```bash copy
gh attestation verify PATH/TO/YOUR/BUILD/ARTIFACT-BINARY -R ORGANIZATION_NAME/REPOSITORY_NAME --bundle sha256:ae57936def59bc4c75edd3a837d89bcefc6d3a5e31d55a6fa7a71624f92c3c3b.jsonl --custom-trusted-root trusted_root.jsonl
```

## Prerequisites

{% data reusables.actions.custom-deployment-protection-rules-beta-note %}

For general information about deployment protection rules, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/concepts/use-cases/deploying-with-github-actions#using-custom-deployment-protection-rules).

## Creating a custom deployment protection rule with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}

1. Create a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/creating-a-github-app). Configure the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} as follows.
   1. Optionally, in the **Callback URL** text field under "Identifying and authorizing users," enter the callback URL. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/about-the-user-authorization-callback-url).
   1. Under "Permissions," select **Repository permissions**.
   1. To the right of "Actions," click the drop down menu and select **Access: Read-only**.
   ![Screenshot of the "Repository permissions" section for a new GitHub App. The Actions permission shows "Read-only" and is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/actions-repo-permissions-read-only.png)
   1. To the right of "Deployments," click the drop down menu and select **Access: Read and write**.

   1. Under "Subscribe to events," select **Deployment protection rule**.
   ![Screenshot of the "Subscribe to events section" section for a new GitHub App. The checkbox for the Deployment protection rule is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/actions-subscribe-to-events-deployment-protection-rules.png)

1. Install the custom deployment protection rule in your repositories and enable it for use. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/protecting-deployments/configuring-custom-deployment-protection-rules).

## Approving or rejecting deployments

Once a workflow reaches a job that references an environment that has the custom deployment protection rule enabled, {% data variables.product.company_short %} sends a `POST` request to a URL you configure containing the `deployment_protection_rule` payload. You can write your deployment protection rule to automatically send REST API requests that approve or reject the deployment based on the `deployment_protection_rule` payload. Configure your REST API requests as follows.

1. Validate the incoming `POST` request. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks#validating-payloads-from-github).
1. Use a JSON Web Token to authenticate as a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-as-a-github-app#about-authentication-as-a-github-app).
1. Using the installation ID from the `deployment_protection_rule` webhook payload, generate an install token. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-a-github-app).

   ```shell
   curl --request POST \
   --url "{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID/ACCESS_TOKENS" \
   --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer {jwt}" \
   --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data \
   '{ \
      "repository_ids": [321], \
      "permissions": { \
         "deployments": "write" \
      } \
   }'
   ```

1. Optionally, to add a status report without taking any other action to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, send a `POST` request to `/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID/deployment_protection_rule`. In the request body, omit the `state`. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#review-custom-deployment-protection-rules-for-a-workflow-run). You can post a status report on the same deployment up to 10 times. Status reports support Markdown formatting and can be up to 1024 characters long.

1. To approve or reject a request, send a `POST` request to `/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID/deployment_protection_rule`. In the request body, set the `state` property to either `approved` or `rejected`. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#review-custom-deployment-protection-rules-for-a-workflow-run).

1. Optionally, request the status of an approval for a workflow run by sending a `GET` request to `/repos/OWNER/REPOSITORY_ID/actions/runs/RUN_ID/approvals`. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#get-the-review-history-for-a-workflow-run).

1. Optionally, review the deployment on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments).

## Publishing custom deployment protection rules in the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}

You can publish your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} to allow developers to discover suitable protection rules and install it across their {% data variables.product.company_short %} repositories. Or you can browse existing custom deployment protection rules to suit your needs. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/about-github-marketplace) and [AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace).

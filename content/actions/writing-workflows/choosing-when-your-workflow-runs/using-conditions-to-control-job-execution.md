## Overview

{% data reusables.actions.workflows.skipped-job-status-checks-passing %}

{% data reusables.actions.jobs.section-using-conditions-to-control-job-execution %}

On a skipped job, you should see "This check was skipped."

> [!NOTE]
> In some parts of the workflow you cannot use environment variables. Instead you can use contexts to access the value of an environment variable. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#using-the-env-context-to-access-environment-variable-values).

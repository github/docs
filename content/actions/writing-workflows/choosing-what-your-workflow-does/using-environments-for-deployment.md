## About environments

{% data reusables.actions.about-environments %}

Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment. Any protection rules configured for the environment must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner. The job can access the environment's secrets only after the job is sent to a runner.

When a workflow references an environment, the environment will appear in the repository's deployments. For more information about viewing current and previous deployments, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/deployment/managing-your-deployments/viewing-deployment-history).

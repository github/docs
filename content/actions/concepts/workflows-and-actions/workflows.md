## About workflows

{% data reusables.actions.about-workflows-long %}

## Workflow basics

A workflow must contain the following basic components:

1. One or more _events_ that will trigger the workflow.
1. One or more _jobs_, each of which will execute on a _runner_ machine and run a series of one or more _steps_.
1. Each step can either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

For more information on these basic components, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions).

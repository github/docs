A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% data variables.product.github %}.

Self-hosted runners:

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
* Give you more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners provide. Be aware that you are responsible for updating the operating system and all other software.{% endif %}
* Are free to use with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, but you are responsible for the cost of maintaining your runner machines.
* Let you create custom hardware configurations that meet your needs with processing power or memory to run larger jobs, install software available on your local network.
* Receive automatic updates for the self-hosted runner application only, though you may disable automatic updates of the runner.
* Can use cloud services or local machines that you already pay for.
* Don't need to have a clean instance for every job execution.{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}
* Can be organized into groups to restrict access to specific workflows, organizations, and repositories. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups).{% endif %}
* Can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.

You can use self-hosted runners anywhere in the management hierarchy. Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository, while organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization. Organization owners can choose which repositories are allowed to create repository-level self-hosted runners. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#limiting-the-use-of-self-hosted-runners). Finally, enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.

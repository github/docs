{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

You can see whether a workflow run is in progress or complete from the workflow run page. You must be logged in to a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account to view workflow run information, including for public repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github)."

If the run is complete, you can see whether the result was a success, failure, canceled, or neutral. If the run failed, you can view and search the build logs to diagnose the failure and re-run the workflow. You can also view billable job execution minutes, or download logs and build artifacts.

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} use the Checks API to output statuses, results, and logs for a workflow. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} creates a new check suite for each workflow run. The check suite contains a check run for each job in the workflow, and each job includes steps. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} are run as a step in a workflow. For more information about the Checks API, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/checks)."

{% data reusables.actions.invalid-workflow-files %}

## Viewing logs to diagnose failures

If your workflow run fails, you can see which step caused the failure and review the failed step's build logs to troubleshoot. You can see the time it took for each step to run. You can also copy a permalink to a specific line in the log file to share with your team. {% data reusables.repositories.permissions-statement-read %}

In addition to the steps configured in the workflow file, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} adds two additional steps to each job to set up and complete the job's execution. These steps are logged in the workflow run with the names "Set up job" and "Complete job".

For jobs run on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners, "Set up job" records details of the runner image, and includes a link to the list of preinstalled tools that were present on the runner machine.

## Searching logs

You can search the build logs for a particular step. When you search logs, only expanded steps are included in the results. {% data reusables.repositories.permissions-statement-read %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}

{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-job %}
1. In the upper-right corner of the log output, in the **Search logs** search box, type a search query.

## Downloading logs

You can download the log files from your workflow run. You can also download a workflow's artifacts. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)." {% data reusables.repositories.permissions-statement-read %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-job %}
1. In the upper right corner of the log, select the {% octicon "gear" aria-label="Show options" %} dropdown menu, then click **Download log archive**.

   ![Screenshot of the log for a job. In the header, a gear icon is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/download-logs-drop-down.png)

  {% ifversion re-run-jobs %}

  {% note %}

  **Note**: When you download the log archive for a workflow that was partially re-run, the archive only includes the jobs that were re-run. To get a complete set of logs for jobs that were run from a workflow, you must download the log archives for the previous run attempts that ran the other jobs.

  {% endnote %}

  {% endif %}

## Deleting logs

You can delete the log files from your workflow runs through the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} web interface or programmatically. {% data reusables.repositories.permissions-statement-write %}

### Deleting logs via the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} web interface

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-workflow %}
{% data reusables.repositories.view-run %}
1. In the upper-right corner, select the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Show workflow options" %} dropdown menu, then click **Delete all logs**.

    ![Screenshot of the page for a workflow run. In the top-right corner, a button, labeled with a kebab icon, is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/actions/workflow-run-kebab-horizontal-icon.png)

1. Review the confirmation prompt.

After deleting logs, the **Delete all logs** button is removed to indicate that no log files remain in the workflow run.

### Deleting logs programmatically

You can use the following script to automatically delete all logs for a workflow. This can be a useful way to clean up logs for multiple workflow runs.

To run the example script below:

1. Copy the code example and save it to a file called `delete-logs.sh`.
1. Grant it the execute permission with `chmod +x delete-logs.sh`.
1. Run the following command, where `REPOSITORY_NAME` is the name of your repository and `WORKFLOW_NAME` is the file name of your workflow.

    ```shell copy
    ./delete-logs.sh REPOSITORY_NAME WORKFLOW_NAME
    ```

    For example, to delete all of the logs in the `monalisa/octocat` repository for the `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` workflow, you would run `./delete-logs.sh monalisa/octocat ci.yaml`.

#### Example script

```bash copy
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Delete all logs for a given workflow
# Usage: delete-logs.sh <repository> <workflow-name>

set -oe pipefail

REPOSITORY=$1
WORKFLOW_NAME=$2

# Validate arguments
if [[ -z "$REPOSITORY" ]]; then
  echo "Repository is required"
  exit 1
fi

if [[ -z "$WORKFLOW_NAME" ]]; then
  echo "Workflow name is required"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Getting all completed runs for workflow $WORKFLOW_NAME in $REPOSITORY"

RUNS=$(
  gh api \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
    "/repos/$REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/$WORKFLOW_NAME/runs" \
    --paginate \
    --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.conclusion != "") | .id'
)

echo "Found $(echo "$RUNS" | wc -l) completed runs for workflow $WORKFLOW_NAME"

# Delete logs for each run
for RUN in $RUNS; do
  echo "Deleting logs for run $RUN"
  gh api \
    --silent \
    --method DELETE \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
    "/repos/$REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$RUN/logs" || echo "Failed to delete logs for run $RUN"

  # Sleep for 100ms to avoid rate limiting
  sleep 0.1
done
```

## Viewing logs with {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}

{% data reusables.cli.cli-learn-more %}

To view the log for a specific job, use the `run view` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of run that you want to view logs for. {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run. If you don't specify `run-id`, {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run, and then returns another interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run.

```shell
gh run view RUN_ID --log
```

You can also use the `--job` flag to specify a job ID. Replace `job-id` with the ID of the job that you want to view logs for.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log
```

You can use `grep` to search the log. For example, this command will return all log entries that contain the word `error`.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log | grep error
```

To filter the logs for any failed steps, use `--log-failed` instead of `--log`.

```shell
gh run view --job JOB_ID --log-failed
```

[Legal notice](#legal-notice)

This article provides general information for configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %}'s supplemental arguments and settings, such as optional parameters, path arguments, and network settings.

## Optional parameters

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} has several optional parameters that you can use to customize the migration process.

### Limiting allowed actions

The following options can be used to limit which actions are allowed in converted workflows. When used in combination, these options expand the list of allowed actions. If none of these options are supplied, then all actions are allowed.

* `--allowed-actions` specifies a list of actions to allow in converted workflows. Wildcards are supported. Any other actions other than those provided will be disallowed.

  For example:

  ```shell
  --allowed-actions {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %} actions/upload-artifact@* my-org/*
  ```

  You can provide an empty list to disallow all actions. For example, `--allowed-actions=`.

* `--allow-verified-actions` specifies that all actions from verified creators are allowed.

* `--allow-github-created-actions` specifies that actions published from the `github` or `actions` organizations are allowed.

  For example, such actions include `github/super-linter` and `actions/checkout`.

  This option is equivalent to `--allowed-actions actions/* github/*`.

### Using a credentials file for authentication

The `--credentials-file` parameter specifies the path to a file containing credentials for different servers that {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} can authenticate to. This is useful when build scripts (such as `.travis.yml` or `jenkinsfile`) are stored in multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances.

A credentials file must be a YAML file containing a list of server and access token combinations. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} uses the credentials for the URL that most closely matches the network request being made.

For example:

```yaml
- url: https://github.com
  access_token: ghp_mygeneraltoken
- url: https://github.com/specific_org/
  access_token: ghp_myorgspecifictoken
- url: https://jenkins.org
  access_token: abc123
  username: marty_mcfly
```

For the above credentials file, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} uses the access token `ghp_mygeneraltoken` to authenticate all network requests to `https://github.com`, _unless_ the network request is for a repository in the `specific_org` organization. In that case, the `ghp_myorgspecifictoken` token is used to authenticate instead.

#### Alternative source code providers

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} can automatically fetch source code from non-{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories. A credentials file can specify the `provider`, the provider URL, and the credentials needed to retrieve the source code.

For example:

```yaml
- url: https://gitlab.com
  access_token: super_secret_token
  provider: gitlab
```

For the above example, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} uses the token `super_secret_token` to retrieve any source code that is hosted on `https://gitlab.com`.

Supported values for `provider` are:

* `github` (default)
* `gitlab`
* `bitbucket_server`
* `azure_devops`

### Controlling optional features

You can use the `--features` option to limit the features used in workflows that {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} creates. This is useful for excluding newer {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} syntax from workflows when migrating to an older {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance. When using the `--features` option, you must specify the version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} that you are migrating to.

For example:

```shell
gh actions-importer dry-run ... --features ghes-3.3
```

The supported values for `--features` are:

* `all` (default value)
* `ghes-latest`
* `ghes-<number>`, where `<number>` is the version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, `3.0` or later. For example, `ghes-3.3`.

You can view the list of available feature flags by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} by running the `list-features` command. For example:

```shell copy
gh actions-importer list-features
```

You should see an output similar to the following.

<!-- markdownlint-disable search-replace -->

```shell
Available feature flags:

actions/cache (disabled):
        Control usage of actions/cache inside of workflows. Outputs a comment if not enabled.
        GitHub Enterprise Server >= ghes-3.5 required.

composite-actions (enabled):
        Minimizes resulting workflow complexity through the use of composite actions. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action for more information.
        GitHub Enterprise Server >= ghes-3.4 required.

reusable-workflows (disabled):
        Avoid duplication by re-using existing workflows. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows for more information.
        GitHub Enterprise Server >= ghes-3.4 required.

workflow-concurrency-option-allowed (enabled):
        Allows the use of the `concurrency` option in workflows. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency for more information.
        GitHub Enterprise Server >= ghes-3.2 required.

Enable features by passing --enable-features feature-1 feature-2
Disable features by passing --disable-features feature-1 feature-2
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable search-replace -->

To toggle feature flags, you can use either of the following methods:
* Use the `--enable-features` and `--disable-features` options when running a `gh actions-importer` command.
* Use an environment variable for each feature flag.

You can use the `--enable-features` and `--disable-features` options to select specific features to enable or disable for the duration of the command.
For example, the following command disables use of `actions/cache` and `composite-actions`:

```shell
gh actions-importer dry-run ... --disable-features=composite-actions actions/cache
```

You can use the `configure --features` command to interactively configure feature flags and automatically write them to your environment:

```shell
$ gh actions-importer configure --features

✔ Which features would you like to configure?: actions/cache, reusable-workflows
✔ actions/cache (disabled): Enable
? reusable-workflows (disabled):
› Enable
  Disable
```

### Disabling network response caching

By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} caches responses from network requests to reduce network load and reduce run time. You can use the `--no-http-cache` option to disable the network cache. For example:

```shell
gh actions-importer forecast ... --no-http-cache
```

## Path arguments

When running {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %}, path arguments are relative to the container's disk, so absolute paths relative to the container's host machine are not supported. When {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} is run, the container's `/data` directory is mounted to the directory where {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} is run.

For example, the following command, when used in the `/Users/mona` directory, outputs the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} audit summary to the `/Users/mona/out` directory:

```shell
gh actions-importer audit --output-dir /data/out
```

## Using a proxy

To access servers that are configured with a HTTP proxy, you must set the following environment variables with the proxy's URL:

* `OCTOKIT_PROXY`: for any {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} server.
* `HTTP_PROXY` (or `HTTPS_PROXY`): for any other servers.

For example:

```shell
export OCTOKIT_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8443
export HTTPS_PROXY=$OCTOKIT_PROXY
```

If the proxy requires authentication, a username and password must be included in the proxy URL. For example, `https://username:password@proxy.url:port`.

## Disabling SSL certificate verification

By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions_importer %} verifies SSL certificates when making network requests. You can disable SSL certificate verification with the `--no-ssl-verify` option. For example:

```shell
gh actions-importer audit --output-dir ./output --no-ssl-verify
```

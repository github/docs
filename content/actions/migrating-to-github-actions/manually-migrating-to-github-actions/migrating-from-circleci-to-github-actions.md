{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

## Introduction

CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} both allow you to create workflows that automatically build, test, publish, release, and deploy code. CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} share some similarities in workflow configuration:

* Workflow configuration files are written in YAML and stored in the repository.
* Workflows include one or more jobs.
* Jobs include one or more steps or individual commands.
* Steps or tasks can be reused and shared with the community.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)."

## Key differences

When migrating from CircleCI, consider the following differences:

* CircleCI’s automatic test parallelism automatically groups tests according to user-specified rules or historical timing information. This functionality is not built into {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.
* Actions that execute in Docker containers are sensitive to permissions problems since containers have a different mapping of users. You can avoid many of these problems by not using the `USER` instruction in your _Dockerfile_. For more information about the Docker filesystem on {% data variables.product.product_name %}-hosted runners, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#docker-container-filesystem)."

## Migrating workflows and jobs

CircleCI defines `workflows` in the _config.yml_ file, which allows you to configure more than one workflow. {% data variables.product.product_name %} requires one workflow file per workflow, and as a consequence, does not require you to declare `workflows`. You'll need to create a new workflow file for each workflow configured in _config.yml_.

Both CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} configure `jobs` in the configuration file using similar syntax. If you configure any dependencies between jobs using `requires` in your CircleCI workflow, you can use the equivalent {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} `needs` syntax. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds)."

## Migrating orbs to actions

Both CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} provide a mechanism to reuse and share tasks in a workflow. CircleCI uses a concept called orbs, written in YAML, to provide tasks that people can reuse in a workflow. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} has powerful and flexible reusable components called actions, which you build with either JavaScript files or Docker images. You can create actions by writing custom code that interacts with your repository in any way you'd like, including integrating with {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s APIs and any publicly available third-party API. For example, an action can publish npm modules, send SMS alerts when urgent issues are created, or deploy production-ready code. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/creating-actions)."

CircleCI can reuse pieces of workflows with YAML anchors and aliases. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} supports the most common need for reusability using matrices. For more information about matrices, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)."

## Using Docker images

Both CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} support running steps inside of a Docker image.

CircleCI provides a set of pre-built images with common dependencies. These images have the `USER` set to `circleci`, which causes permissions to conflict with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

We recommend that you move away from CircleCI's pre-built images when you migrate to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. In many cases, you can use actions to install the additional dependencies you need.

For more information about the Docker filesystem, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#docker-container-filesystem)."

For more information about the tools and packages available on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner images, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software)".

## Using variables and secrets

CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} support setting variables in the configuration file and creating secrets using the CircleCI or {% data variables.product.product_name %} UI.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)."

## Caching

CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} provide a method to manually cache files in the configuration file.

Below is an example of the syntax for each system.

### CircleCI syntax for caching

{% raw %}

```yaml
- restore_cache:
    keys:
      - v1-npm-deps-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
      - v1-npm-deps-
```

{% endraw %}

### GitHub Actions syntax for caching

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-cache %}
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: {% raw %}v1-npm-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}{% endraw %}
    restore-keys: v1-npm-deps-
```

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} does not have an equivalent of CircleCI’s Docker Layer Caching (or DLC).

## Persisting data between jobs

Both CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} provide mechanisms to persist data between jobs.

Below is an example in CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} configuration syntax.

### CircleCI syntax for persisting data between jobs

{% raw %}

```yaml
- persist_to_workspace:
    root: workspace
    paths:
      - math-homework.txt

...

- attach_workspace:
    at: /tmp/workspace
```

{% endraw %}

### GitHub Actions syntax for persisting data between jobs

```yaml
- name: Upload math result for job 1
  uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-upload-artifact %}
  with:
    name: homework
    path: math-homework.txt

...

- name: Download math result for job 1
  uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-download-artifact %}
  with:
    name: homework
```

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)."

## Using databases and service containers

Both systems enable you to include additional containers for databases, caching, or other dependencies.

In CircleCI, the first image listed in the _config.yaml_ is the primary image used to run commands. {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses explicit sections: use `container` for the primary container, and list additional containers in `services`.

Below is an example in CircleCI and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} configuration syntax.

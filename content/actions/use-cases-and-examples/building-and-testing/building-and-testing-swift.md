{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to build and test a Swift package.

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners have a tools cache with preinstalled software, and the Ubuntu and macOS runners include the dependencies for building Swift packages. For a full list of up-to-date software and the preinstalled versions of Swift and Xcode, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-software)."

## Prerequisites

You should already be familiar with YAML syntax and how it's used with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)."

We recommend that you have a basic understanding of Swift packages. For more information, see "[Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/swift-packages)" in the Apple developer documentation.

## Using a Swift workflow template

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-templates-get-started %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} provides a workflow template for Swift that should work for most Swift projects. The subsequent sections of this guide give examples of how you can customize this workflow template.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
{% data reusables.actions.new-starter-workflow %}
1. The "Choose a workflow" page shows a selection of recommended workflow templates. Search for "swift".
1. Filter the selection of workflows by clicking **Continuous integration**.
1. On the "Swift" workflow, click **Configure**.

{%- ifversion ghes %}

   If you don't find the "Swift" workflow template, copy the following workflow code to a new file called `swift.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

   ```yaml copy
   name: Swift

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main" ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: macos-latest

       steps:
       - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
       - name: Build
         run: swift build -v
       - name: Run tests
         run: swift test -v
   ```

{%- endif %}

1. Edit the workflow as required. For example, change the branch on which the workflow will run.
1. Click **Commit changes**.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
   The `swift.yml` workflow file is added to the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
{% endif %}

## Specifying a Swift version

To use a specific preinstalled version of Swift on a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner, use the `swift-actions/setup-swift` action. This action finds a specific version of Swift from the tools cache on the runner and adds the necessary binaries to `PATH`. These changes will persist for the remainder of a job. For more information, see the [`swift-actions/setup-swift`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-swift) action.

If you are using a self-hosted runner, you must install your desired Swift versions and add them to `PATH`.

The examples below demonstrate using the `swift-actions/setup-swift` action.

### Using multiple Swift versions

You can configure your job to use multiple versions of Swift in a matrix.

```yaml copy

{% data reusables.actions.actions-not-certified-by-github-comment %}

{% data reusables.actions.actions-use-sha-pinning-comment %}

name: Swift

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    name: {% raw %}Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }}{% endraw %}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        swift: ["5.2", "5.3"]
    runs-on: {% raw %}${{ matrix.os }}{% endraw %}
    steps:
      - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@65540b95f51493d65f5e59e97dcef9629ddf11bf
        with:
          swift-version: {% raw %}${{ matrix.swift }}{% endraw %}
      - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
      - name: Build
        run: swift build
      - name: Run tests
        run: swift test
```

### Using a single specific Swift version

You can configure your job to use a single specific version of Swift, such as `5.3.3`.

{% raw %}

```yaml copy
steps:
  - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@65540b95f51493d65f5e59e97dcef9629ddf11bf
    with:
      swift-version: "5.3.3"
  - name: Get swift version
    run: swift --version # Swift 5.3.3
```

{% endraw %}

## Building and testing your code

You can use the same commands that you use locally to build and test your code using Swift. This example demonstrates how to use `swift build` and `swift test` in a job:

```yaml copy
steps:
  - uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
  - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@65540b95f51493d65f5e59e97dcef9629ddf11bf
    with:
      swift-version: "5.3.3"
  - name: Build
    run: swift build
  - name: Run tests
    run: swift test
```

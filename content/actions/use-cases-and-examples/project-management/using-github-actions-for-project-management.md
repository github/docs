You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to automate your project management tasks by creating workflows. Each workflow contains a series of tasks that are performed automatically every time the workflow runs. For example, you can create a workflow that runs every time an issue is created to add a label{% ifversion projects-v1 %}, move the issue onto a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %},{% endif %} and leave a comment.

## When do workflows run?

You can configure your workflows to run on a schedule or be triggered when an event occurs. For example, you can set your workflow to run when someone creates an issue in a repository.

Many workflow triggers are useful for automating project management.

* An issue is opened, assigned, or labeled.
* A comment is added to an issue.
* A scheduled time.

For a full list of events that can trigger workflows, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

## What can workflows do?

Workflows can do many things, such as commenting on an issue, adding or removing labels, {% ifversion projects-v1 %}moving cards on {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_boards %}, {% endif %}and opening issues.

You can learn about using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for project management by following these tutorials, which include example workflows that you can adapt to meet your needs.

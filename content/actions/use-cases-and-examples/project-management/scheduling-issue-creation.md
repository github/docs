{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} to create an issue on a regular basis. For example, you can create an issue each week to use as the agenda for a team meeting. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/using-github-cli-in-workflows).

In the tutorial, you will first make a workflow file that uses the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. Then, you will customize the workflow to suit your needs.

## Creating the workflow

1. {% data reusables.actions.choose-repo %}
1. {% data reusables.actions.make-workflow-file %}
1. Copy the following YAML contents into your workflow file.

    ```yaml copy
    name: Weekly Team Sync
    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: 20 07 * * 1

    jobs:
      create_issue:
        name: Create team sync issue
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
          issues: write
        steps:
          - name: Create team sync issue
            run: |
              if [[ $CLOSE_PREVIOUS == true ]]; then
                previous_issue_number=$(gh issue list \
                  --label "$LABELS" \
                  --json number \
                  --jq '.[0].number')
                if [[ -n $previous_issue_number ]]; then
                  gh issue close "$previous_issue_number"
                  gh issue unpin "$previous_issue_number"
                fi
              fi
              new_issue_url=$(gh issue create \
                --title "$TITLE" \
                --assignee "$ASSIGNEES" \
                --label "$LABELS" \
                --body "$BODY")
              if [[ $PINNED == true ]]; then
                gh issue pin "$new_issue_url"
              fi
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
              GH_REPO: {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %}
              TITLE: Team sync
              ASSIGNEES: monalisa,doctocat,hubot
              LABELS: weekly sync,docs-team
              BODY: |
                ### Agenda

                - [ ] Start the recording
                - [ ] Check-ins
                - [ ] Discussion points
                - [ ] Post the recording

                ### Discussion Points
                Add things to discuss below

                - [Work this week](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/3)
              PINNED: false
              CLOSE_PREVIOUS: false
    ```

1. Customize the parameters in your workflow file:
   * Change the value for `on.schedule` to dictate when you want this workflow to run. In the example above, the workflow will run every Monday at 7:20 UTC. For more information about scheduled workflows, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events).
   * Change the value for `ASSIGNEES` to the list of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} usernames that you want to assign to the issue.
   * Change the value for `LABELS` to the list of labels that you want to apply to the issue.
   * Change the value for `TITLE` to the title that you want the issue to have.
   * Change the value for `BODY` to the text that you want in the issue body. The `|` character allows you to use a multi-line value for this parameter.
   * If you want to pin this issue in your repository, set `PINNED` to `true`. For more information about pinned issues, see [AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository).
   * If you want to close the previous issue generated by this workflow each time a new issue is created, set `CLOSE_PREVIOUS` to `true`. The workflow will close the most recent issue that has the labels defined in the `labels` field. To avoid closing the wrong issue, use a unique label or combination of labels.
1. {% data reusables.actions.commit-workflow %}

## Expected results

Based on the `schedule` parameter (for example, every Monday at 7:20 UTC), your workflow will create a new issue with the assignees, labels, title, and body that you specified. If you set `PINNED` to `true`, the workflow will pin the issue to your repository. If you set `CLOSE_PREVIOUS` to true, the workflow will close the most recent issue with matching labels.

> [!NOTE]

You can view the history of your workflow runs to see this workflow run periodically. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/viewing-workflow-run-history).

{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-github-hosted-runners %}

## Introduction

This guide explains how to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to build a containerized application, push it to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), and deploy it to [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) when there is a push to the `main` branch.

On every new push to `main` in your {% data variables.product.company_short %} repository, the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow builds and pushes a new container image to Amazon ECR, and then deploys a new task definition to Amazon ECS.

{% endnote %}

## Prerequisites

Before creating your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow, you will first need to complete the following setup steps for Amazon ECR and ECS:

1. Create an Amazon ECR repository to store your images.

   For example, using [the AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):

   {% raw %}

   ```bash copy
   aws ecr create-repository \
       --repository-name MY_ECR_REPOSITORY \
       --region MY_AWS_REGION

   ```

   {% endraw %}

   Ensure that you use the same Amazon ECR repository name (represented here by `MY_ECR_REPOSITORY`) for the `ECR_REPOSITORY` variable in the workflow below.

   Ensure that you use the same AWS region value for the `AWS_REGION` (represented here by `MY_AWS_REGION`) variable in the workflow below.

1. Create an Amazon ECS task definition, cluster, and service.

   For details, follow the [Getting started wizard on the Amazon ECS console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun), or the [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/getting-started-fargate.html) in the Amazon ECS documentation.

   Ensure that you note the names you set for the Amazon ECS service and cluster, and use them for the `ECS_SERVICE` and `ECS_CLUSTER` variables in the workflow below.

1. Store your Amazon ECS task definition as a JSON file in your {% data variables.product.company_short %} repository.

   The format of the file should be the same as the output generated by:

   {% raw %}

   ```bash copy

   aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton

   ```

   {% endraw %}

   Ensure that you set the `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` variable in the workflow below as the path to the JSON file.

   Ensure that you set the `CONTAINER_NAME` variable in the workflow below as the container name in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.

1. Create {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to store the values for your Amazon IAM access key.

   For more information on creating secrets for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)."

   See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for the IAM user, and methods for handling the access key credentials.

1. Optionally, configure a deployment environment. {% data reusables.actions.about-environments %}

## Creating the workflow

Once you've completed the prerequisites, you can proceed with creating the workflow.

The following example workflow demonstrates how to build a container image and push it to Amazon ECR. It then updates the task definition with the new image ID, and deploys the task definition to Amazon ECS.

Ensure that you provide your own values for all the variables in the `env` key of the workflow.

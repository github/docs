## About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to private {% ifversion internal-actions %} or internal {% endif %}repositories

You can share actions and reusable workflows within your organization, without publishing them publicly, by allowing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows to access a private {% ifversion internal-actions %}  {% endif %}repository that contains the action or reusable workflow.

Any actions or reusable workflows stored in the private repository can be used in workflows defined in other private repositories owned by the same organization. Actions and reusable workflows stored in private repositories cannot be used in public repositories.

## Sharing actions and workflows with your organization

1. Store the action or reusable workflow in a private {% ifversion internal-actions %} or internal {% endif %}repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)."
1. Configure the repository to allow access to workflows in other private repositories.

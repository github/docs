## About successors

We recommend inviting another {% data variables.product.company_short %} user to be your successor, to manage your user owned repositories if you cannot. As a successor, they will have permission to:

- Archive your public repositories.
- Transfer your public repositories to their own user owned account.
- Transfer your public repositories to an organization where they can create repositories.

Successors cannot log into your account.

An appointed successor can manage your public repositories after presenting a death certificate then waiting for 7 days or presenting an obituary then waiting for 21 days. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy)."

To request access to manage repositories as a successor, please contact us through the {% data variables.contact.contact_support_portal %}.

## Inviting a successor

The person you invite to be your successor must have a {% data variables.product.company_short %} account.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.account_settings %}

1. Under "Successor settings", to invite a successor, begin typing a username, full name, or email address, then click their name when it appears.

   ![Screenshot of the "Successor settings" section. The string "octocat" is entered in a search field, and Octocat's profile is listed in a dropdown below.](/assets/images/help/settings/settings-invite-successor-search-field.png)

1. Click **Add successor**.
{% data reusables.user-settings.sudo-mode-popup %}

The user you've invited will be listed as "Pending" until they agree to become your successor.

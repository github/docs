## About management of security and analysis settings

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can help secure your repositories. This topic tells you how you can manage the security and analysis features for all your existing or new repositories.

You can still manage the security and analysis features for individual repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

You can also review the security log for all activity on your personal account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log)."

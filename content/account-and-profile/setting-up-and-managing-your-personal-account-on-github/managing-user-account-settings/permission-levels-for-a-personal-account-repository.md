## About permissions levels for a personal account repository

Repositories owned by personal accounts have one owner. Ownership permissions can't be shared with another personal account.

You can also {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}invite{% else %}add{% endif %} users on {% data variables.product.product_name %} to your repository as collaborators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)."

{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you require more granular access to a repository owned by your personal account, consider transferring the repository to an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account)."

{% endtip %}

## Collaborator access for a repository owned by a personal account

Collaborators on a personal repository can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository.

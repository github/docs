{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}

{% ifversion ghec %}

**Note**: Members of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %} cannot change usernames. Your enterprise's IdP administrator controls your username for {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users)."

{% elsif ghes %}

**Note**: If you sign into {% data variables.location.product_location %} with LDAP credentials or single sign-on (SSO), only your local administrator can change your username. For more information about authentication methods for {% data variables.product.product_name %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise)."

{% endif %}

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

## About username changes

You can change your username to another username that is not currently in use.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If the username you want is not available, consider other names or unique variations. Using a number, hyphen, or an alternative spelling might help you find a similar username that's still available.

If you hold a trademark for the username, you can find more information about making a trademark complaint on our [Trademark Policy](/free-pro-team@latest/site-policy/content-removal-policies/github-trademark-policy) page.

If you do not hold a trademark for the name, you can choose another username or keep your current username. {% data variables.contact.github_support %} cannot release the unavailable username for you. For more information, see "[Changing your username](#changing-your-username)."{% endif %}

After changing your username, your old username becomes available for anyone else to claim. Most references to your repositories under the old username automatically change to the new username. However, some links to your profile won't automatically redirect.

{% data variables.product.product_name %} cannot set up redirects for:
* [@mentions](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) using your old username
* Links to [gists](/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) that include your old username

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

If you're a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, you cannot make changes to your username. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-more-info-account %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% data reusables.accounts.rename-account-repo-namespace-retirement %} If you try to create a repository using a retired owner name and repository name combination, you will see the error: "The repository `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` has been retired and cannot be reused."

{% endif %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.rename-account-namespace-retirement %}

## Repository references

After you change your username, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will automatically redirect references to your repositories.
* Web links to your existing repositories will continue to work. This can take a few minutes to complete after you make the change.
* Command line pushes from your local repository clones to the old remote tracking URLs will continue to work.

If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working. Because of this possibility, we recommend you update all existing remote repository URLs after changing your username. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories)."

## Links to your previous profile page

After changing your username, links to your previous profile page, such as `https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/previoususername`, will return a 404 error. We recommend updating any links to your profile from elsewhere{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, such as your LinkedIn or Twitter profile{% endif %}.

## Accounts logged in on GitHub Mobile

Accounts logged in on the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} app may continue to display your original username until you log out. To ensure your updated username is displayed, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account on each mobile device.

## Your Git commits

If your Git commits are associated with another email address you've added to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account, they'll continue to be attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph after you've changed your username. For more information on setting your email address, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}If you've been using a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-provided private commit email address, whether or not your commit history will be retained after an account rename depends on the format of the email address. Git commits that are associated with your {% data variables.product.product_name %}-provided `noreply` email address won't be attributed to your new username and won't appear in your contributions graph, unless your `noreply` email address is in the form of `ID+USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com`. Older versions of the `noreply` email address that do not contain a numeric ID will not be associated with your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account after changing your username.{% endif %}

{% warning %}

**Warnings:**

* After a username change, verified commits signed using the previous {% data variables.product.product_name %}-provided `noreply` email address will lose their "Verified" status.
* When verifying a signature, {% data variables.product.product_name %} checks that the email address of the committer or tagger exactly matches one of the email addresses associated with the GPG key's identities. Additionally, {% data variables.product.product_name %} confirms that the email address is verified and linked to the user's account. This ensures that the key belongs to you and that you created the commit or tag. Because the username of the `noreply` email address changes, these commits can no longer be verified.

{% endwarning %}

## Your gists

After changing your username, the URLs to any public or secret gists will also change and previous links to these will return a 404 error. We recommend updating the links to these gists anywhere you may have shared them.

## CODEOWNERS files

After changing your username, CODEOWNERS files that include your old username will need to be manually updated. When you view the CODEOWNERS files on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, an error message is displayed if the file contains any unknown users, or users without write access. We recommend updating all relevant CODEOWNERS files with your new username. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)."

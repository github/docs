## About unlinking your email address

Since an email address can only be associated with a single {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account, when you've lost your 2FA credentials and are unable to recover access, unlinking your email address from the locked account allows you to link that email address to a new or existing account. Additionally, linking a previously used commit email address to a new account will connect your commit history to that account. Unless you have chosen to keep your email address private, your account's commit email address is the same as your account's primary email address. See [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

> [!NOTE]
> The {% data variables.product.github %}-provided `noreply` email address cannot be unlinked from an account. Commits authored with a `noreply` address cannot be reconnected to a different account.

Be aware that nothing else associated with your 2FA locked account, including your repositories, permissions, and profile, will transfer to your new account.

## Unlinking your email address

Unlinking email addresses is only available for accounts with 2FA enabled. If you do not have 2FA enabled, you can sign in and remove your email address from your account settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Following these steps will not disable 2FA or provide access to a locked account, but will instead unlink the associated email address so it may be used for a different account. If you cannot regain access to the 2FA locked account, these steps will permanently break the link between the account and the linked email address. Before continuing with this article, be sure you have lost all access to your account. See [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials).

## About commit email addresses

{% data variables.product.github %} uses your commit email address to associate commits with your account on {% data variables.product.github %}. You can choose the email address that will be associated with the commits you push from the command line as well as web-based Git operations you make.

For web-based Git operations, you can set your commit email address on {% data variables.product.github %}. For commits you push from the command line, you can set your commit email address in Git.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Any commits you made prior to changing your commit email address are still associated with your previous email address.{% else %}After changing your commit email address on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the new email address will be visible in all of your future web-based Git operations by default. Any commits you made prior to changing your commit email address are still associated with your previous email address.{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% note %}

**Note**: {% data reusables.user-settings.no-verification-disposable-emails %}

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}To use your `noreply` email address for commits you push from the command line, use that email address when you set your commit email address in Git. To use your `noreply` address for web-based Git operations, set your commit email address on GitHub and choose to **Keep my email address private**.

You can also choose to block commits you push from the command line that expose your personal email address. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address)."{% endif %}

To ensure that commits are attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph, use an email address that is connected to your account on {% data variables.product.github %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, or the `noreply` email address provided to you in your email settings{% endif %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% note %}

**Note:** If you created your account _after_ July 18, 2017, your `noreply` email address for is an ID number and your username in the form of <code>ID+USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com</code>. If you created your account _prior to_ July 18, 2017, and enabled **Keep my email address private** prior to that date, your `noreply` email address is <code>USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com</code>. You can get an ID-based `noreply` email address by selecting (or deselecting and reselecting) **Keep my email address private** in your email settings.

{% endnote %}

If you use your `noreply` email address for {% data variables.product.github %} to make commits and then change your username, those commits will not be associated with your account. This does not apply if you're using the ID-based `noreply` address from {% data variables.product.github %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username)."{% endif %}

## Setting your commit email address on {% data variables.product.github %}

{% data reusables.files.commit-author-email-options %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.emails %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.add_and_verify_email %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.select_primary_email %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.keeping_your_email_address_private %}{% endif %}

## Setting your commit email address in Git

You can use the `git config` command to change the email address you associate with your Git commits. The new email address you set will be visible in any future commits you push to {% data variables.product.github %} from the command line. Any commits you made prior to changing your commit email address are still associated with your previous email address.

### Setting your email address for every repository on your computer

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}

1. {% data reusables.user-settings.set_your_email_address_in_git %}

   ```shell
   git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
   ```

1. {% data reusables.user-settings.confirm_git_email_address_correct %}

   ```shell
   $ git config --global user.email
   email@example.com
   ```

1. {% data reusables.user-settings.link_email_with_your_account %}

### Setting your email address for a single repository

{% data variables.product.github %} uses the email address set in your local Git configuration to associate commits pushed from the command line with your account on {% data variables.product.github %}.

You can change the email address associated with commits you make in a single repository. This will override your global Git configuration settings in this one repository, but will not affect any other repositories.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}

1. Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the email address that you associate with your Git commits.
1. {% data reusables.user-settings.set_your_email_address_in_git %}

   ```shell
   git config user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
   ```

1. {% data reusables.user-settings.confirm_git_email_address_correct %}

   ```shell
   $ git config user.email
   email@example.com
   ```

1. {% data reusables.user-settings.link_email_with_your_account %}

* Create or fork repositories
* Create issues or pull requests
* Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
* Authorize {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} applications
* Generate {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}s
* Receive email notifications
* Star repositories
* Create or update projects
* Create or update gists
* Create or use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
* Sponsor developers with {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}

## About email verification{% ifversion ghec %} for {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %}{% endif %}

If you are a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, your email address is considered unverified if it is used as a verified email by another account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. To verify the email, you will need to unverify the email address for the other account, then verify it for your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %}. See "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address)."

Having an unverified email address does not affect most actions you can take on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. However, it may prevent you from accessing some third-party {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}.

{% endif %}

## Verifying your email address

{% data reusables.user-settings.emails %}

## Troubleshooting email verification

### Unable to send verification email

{% data reusables.user-settings.no-verification-disposable-emails %}

### Error page after clicking verification link

The verification link expires after 24 hours. If you don't verify your email within 24 hours, you can request another email verification link. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address#verifying-your-email-address)."

If you click on the link in the confirmation email within 24 hours and you are directed to an error page, you should ensure that you're signed into the correct account on {% data variables.product.github %}.

1. Sign out of your account.
1. Quit and restart your browser.
1. Sign in to your account.
1. Click on the verification link in the email we sent you.

{% ifversion ghec %}

### Email is already verified by another user

If you see the error message `Error adding EMAIL: Email is already verified by another user`, you must either unverify the email for the other account before proceeding, or choose a different email address to verify.

To unverify an email address, delete it in your email settings, then optionally re-add it without verifying to keep any commits linked to your account. See "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address)."

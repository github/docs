## About email verification for personal accounts

You can verify your email address after signing up for a new account, or when you add a new email address. If an email address is undeliverable or bouncing, it will be unverified.

If you do not verify your email address, you will not be able to:
* Create or fork repositories
* Create issues or pull requests
* Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
* Authorize {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} applications
* Generate {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}s
* Receive email notifications
* Star repositories
* Create or update projects
* Create or update gists
* Create or use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}
* Sponsor developers with {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}
* Accept organization invitations

## About email verification for {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %}

If you are a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %} and your account was created from August 2024, your email address is unverified by default. Having an unverified email address does not affect most actions you can take on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. However, in rare cases it may prevent you from accessing some third-party {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}.

Until you verify your email address, your account will use a placeholder email address with your enterprise's shortcode appended for certain operations. For example, the REST API endpoint for users will return `email+shortcode@domain.com`. In rare cases, you may find that third-party apps or your company's email provider do not handle the placeholder email correctly.

You cannot verify an email address for your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %} if the email address is already verified by another account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. To verify the email, you will need to unverify the email address on the conflicting account, then verify it for your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address).

Once you verify an email with a {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %}, you won't be able to use the email to sign up for a personal account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

## Verifying your email address

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.emails %}
1. Under your email address, click **Resend verification email**.

1. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send you an email with a link in it. After you click that link, you'll be taken to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} dashboard and see a confirmation banner.

## Troubleshooting email verification

### Unable to send verification email

{% data reusables.user-settings.no-verification-disposable-emails %}

### Error page after clicking verification link

The verification link expires after 24 hours. If you don't verify your email within 24 hours, you can request another email verification link. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address#verifying-your-email-address).

If you click on the link in the confirmation email within 24 hours and you are directed to an error page, you should ensure that you're signed into the correct account on {% data variables.product.github %}.

1. Sign out of your account.
1. Quit and restart your browser.
1. Sign in to your account.
1. Click on the verification link in the email we sent you.

### Email is already verified by another user

If you see the error message `Error adding EMAIL: Email is already verified by another user`, you must either unverify the email for the other account before proceeding, or choose a different email address to verify.

To unverify an email address, delete it in your email settings, then optionally re-add it without verifying to keep any commits linked to your account. See [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address).

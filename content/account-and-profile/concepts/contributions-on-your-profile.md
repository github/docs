## About your contribution graph

Your profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you've made to repositories on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. Contributions are timestamped according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than your local time zone.

If you are part of an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), you won’t be able to see contribution activity from the organization on your profile if you do not have an active SSO session. People viewing your profile from outside your organization will see anonymized contribution activity of your contribution activity for your organization.

## Public and private repository activity

By default, your contribution graph and Achievements only show activity from public repositories. You can choose to show activity from both public and private repositories, with specific details of your activity in private repositories anonymized. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-your-private-contributions-and-achievements-on-your-profile).

## Popular repositories

This section displays your repositories with the most watchers. Once you [pin repositories to your profile](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile), this section will change to "Pinned."

## Pinned

This section displays up to six public repositories or gists. Important details are listed for each of the items you've chosen to feature. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

The organizations featured in the activity overview are prioritized according to how active you are in the organization. If you @mention an organization in your profile bio, and you’re an organization member, then that organization is prioritized first in the activity overview. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) or [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile).

## Contribution activity

The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened.

Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity.

If you can't see certain events in your timeline, check to make sure you still have access to the organization or repository where the event happened.

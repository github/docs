You can tell other people a little bit about yourself by writing a bio. Consider including previous places you've worked, projects you've contributed to, or interests you have that other people may like to know about.

You can further showcase your current work, interests, expertise, and more by creating a profile README. If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page.

People who visit your profile can also see:

* A timeline of your contribution activity, like issues and pull requests you've opened, commits you've made, and pull requests you've reviewed
* Repositories and gists you own or contribute to. You can showcase your best work by pinning repositories and gists to your profile.
* Repositories you've starred{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} and organized into lists{% endif %}
* An overview of your activity in organizations, repositories, and teams you're most active in{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

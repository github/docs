{% note %}

**Note:**
  Any details you add to your public {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile will be visible to all {% data variables.product.product_name %} users, including in regions where local laws, regulations, or cultural norms may pose risks to expressing your identity. We respect everyoneâ€™s decision about whether or not to share information about themselves on their {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile.

{% endnote %}

## Changing your profile picture

Your profile picture helps identify you across {% data variables.product.product_name %} in pull requests, comments, contributions pages, and graphs.

When you sign up for an account, {% data variables.product.product_name %} provides you with a randomly generated "identicon". [Your identicon](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons) generates from a hash of your user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern. You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you.

{% note %}

**Note{% ifversion ghec %}s{% endif %}**: {% ifversion ghec %}

* {% endif %}Your profile picture should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file, and it must be less than 1 MB in size and smaller than 3000 by 3000 pixels. For the best quality rendering, we recommend keeping the image at about 500 by 500 pixels.
{% ifversion ghec %}* Gravatar profile pictures are not supported with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}.{% endif %}

{% endnote %}

If you use Gravatar, and your Gravatar image is associated with the email you use for {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the image will be shown as your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile picture by default (rather than an identicon). To change your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile picture, you can either upload a new image to Gravatar, or upload a new image to {% data variables.product.product_name %} and override the Gravatar image.

### Setting a profile picture

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.accounts.set-profile-picture %}

### Resetting your profile picture to the identicon

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Profile Picture", select {% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" %} **Edit**, then click **Remove photo** to revert to your identicon.

   If your email address is associated with a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/), you cannot revert to your identicon. Click **Revert to Gravatar** instead.

   ![Screenshot of the "Public profile" section of a user account's settings. A button, labeled with a pencil icon and "Edit", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/profile/edit-profile-photo.png)

## Changing your profile name

You can change the name that is displayed on your profile. This name may also be displayed next to comments you make on private repositories owned by an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-display-of-member-names-in-your-organization)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
{% note %}

**Note:** If you're a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, any changes to your profile name must be made through your identity provider instead of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-more-info-account %}

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Public profile", in the "Name" field, type the name you want to be displayed on your profile.

## Adding a bio to your profile

Add a bio to your profile to share information about yourself with other {% data variables.product.product_name %} users. With the help of [@mentions](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and emoji, you can include information about where you currently or have previously worked, what type of work you do, or even what kind of coffee you drink.

For a longer-form and more prominent way of displaying customized information about yourself, you can also use a profile README. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)."

{% note %}

**Note:**
  If you have the activity overview section enabled for your profile and you @mention an organization you're a member of in your profile bio, then that organization will be featured first in your activity overview. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-an-overview-of-your-activity-on-your-profile)."

{% endnote %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Public profile", in the "Bio" field, type the content that you want displayed on your profile. The bio field is limited to 160 characters.

   {% tip %}

   **Tip:** When you @mention an organization, only those that you're a member of will autocomplete. You can still @mention organizations that you're not a member of, like a previous employer, but the organization name won't autocomplete for you.

   {% endtip %}

{% data reusables.profile.update-profile %}

{% ifversion profile-pronouns %}

## Adding pronouns to your profile

* On your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile page
* When people hover over your username or avatar on {% data variables.product.product_name %}

![Screenshot of the Octocat profile page emphasizing the location, local time, and relative time fields.](/assets/images/help/profile/profile-location-and-time.png)

When you view your profile, you will see your location, local time, and your time zone in relation to Universal Time Coordinated. When others view your profile, they will see your location, local time, and the time difference in hours from their own local time.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Public profile", in the "Location" field, type the location you want to be displayed on your profile.
1. Optionally, display the current local time on your profile.
   * Select **Display current local time**.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "Social accounts", in a blank "Link to social profile" field, type the full URL of the social account. For example, for the `@GitHub` Twitter account, type `https://twitter.com/github`.
{% data reusables.profile.update-profile %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Adding your ORCID iD to your profile

If you're a researcher with an ORCID iD, you can identify yourself by adding your ORCID iD to your profile.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. Under "ORCID iD", click **Connect your ORCID iD**.
1. Follow the steps to sign in to your ORCID account and then return to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

{% endif %}

## Setting a status

You can set a status to display information about your current availability on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Your status will show:
* On your {% data variables.product.product_name %} profile page
* When people hover over your username or avatar on {% data variables.product.product_name %}
* On a team page for a team where you're a team member. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#team-pages)."
* On the organization dashboard in an organization where you're a member. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-your-organization-dashboard)."

When you set your status, you can also let people know that you have limited availability on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

If you select the "Busy" option, when people @mention your username, assign you an issue or pull request, or request a pull request review from you, a note next to your username will show that you're busy. You will also be excluded from automatic review assignment for pull requests assigned to any teams you belong to. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team)."

## Earning Achievements

Achievements celebrate specific events and actions that happen on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. They will appear as small badges listed in the sidebar of your profile.

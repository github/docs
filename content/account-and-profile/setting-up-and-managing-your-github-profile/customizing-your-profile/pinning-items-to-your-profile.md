You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository. Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)"

You can pin any public gist you own.

Pinned items include important information about the item, like the number of stars a repository has received or the first few lines of a gist. Once you pin items to your profile, the "Pinned" section replaces the "Popular repositories" section on your profile.

You can reorder the items in the "Pinned" section. In the upper-right corner of a pin, click {% octicon "grabber" aria-label="The grabber symbol" %}  and drag the pin to a new location.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
1. At the top of the "Popular repositories" or "Pinned" section, click **Customize your pins**.

1. Optionally, to change which items are included in the searchable list, next to "Show", select or deselect **Repositories** and **Gists**.
1. Optionally, to make it easier to find a specific item, in the "Filter repositories and gists" field, type the name of a user, organization, repository, or gist.
1. Select up to six repositories and gists, combined.
1. Click **Save pins**.

If your organization uses {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you can also view the enterprise owners who manage billing settings and policies for all your enterprise's organizations. For more information, see [the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/viewing-peoples-roles-in-an-organization#view-enterprise-owners-and-their-roles-in-an-organization).

## Viewing enterprise owners and their roles in an organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.people %}
1. In the left sidebar, under "Enterprise permissions", click **Enterprise owners**.

    Depending on their organization role, enterprise owners have different levels of access to organization resources.

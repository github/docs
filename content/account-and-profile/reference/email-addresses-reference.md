## Your `noreply` email address

Your `noreply` email address format depends on when you created your account and your email privacy settings:

* If you created your account _after_ July 18, 2017, your `noreply` email address is an ID number and your username in the form of <code>ID+USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com</code>.
* If you created your account _prior to_ July 18, 2017, and enabled **Keep my email address private** before that date, your `noreply` email address is <code>USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com</code>.
* To get an ID-based `noreply` email address, select (or deselect and reselect) **Keep my email address private** in your email settings.
If you use your `noreply` email address for {% data variables.product.github %} to make commits and then change your username, those commits will not be associated with your account. This does not apply if you're using the ID-based `noreply` address from {% data variables.product.github %}.

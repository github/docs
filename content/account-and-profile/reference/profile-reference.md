## Visibility of profile information

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Any details you add to your public profile will be visible to all {% data variables.product.github %} users, including in regions where local laws, regulations, or cultural norms may pose risks to expressing your identity. We respect everyone's decision about whether or not to share information about themselves on their {% data variables.product.github %} profile.

{% endif %}

The name that is displayed on your profile may also be displayed next to comments you make on private repositories owned by an organization. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-display-of-member-names-in-your-organization).

{% ifversion profile-pronouns %}

{% data reusables.profile.pronouns-visibility %}

{% endif %}

Links to your social accounts are visible to anyone who can view your profile.

## Profile status

Your status will show:

* On your profile page
* When people hover over your username or avatar
* On a team page for a team where you're a team member. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#team-pages).
* On the organization dashboard in an organization where you're a member. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-your-organization-dashboard).

When you set your status, you can also let people know that you have limited availability.

If you select the "Busy" option, when people @mention your username, assign you an issue or pull request, or request a pull request review from you, a note next to your username will show that you're busy. You will also be excluded from automatic review assignment for pull requests assigned to any teams you belong to. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team).

![Screenshot of a draft comment. "@octocat" is written in the text field, and "The Octocat (busy)" is suggested.](/assets/images/help/profile/username-with-limited-availability-text.png)

## Profile picture requirements

When you sign up for an account, {% data variables.product.github %} provides you with a randomly generated "identicon". [Your identicon](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons) generates from a hash of your user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern. You can replace your identicon with an image that represents you.

> [!NOTE] {% ifversion ghec %}
> * {% endif %}Your profile picture should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file, and it must be less than 1 MB in size and smaller than 3000 by 3000 pixels. For the best quality rendering, we recommend keeping the image at about 500 by 500 pixels.
{% ifversion ghec %}> * Gravatar profile pictures are not supported with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}.{% endif %}

If you use Gravatar, and your Gravatar image is associated with the email you use for {% data variables.product.github %}, the image will be shown as your {% data variables.product.github %} profile picture by default (rather than an identicon). To change your profile picture, you can either upload a new image to Gravatar, or upload a new image to {% data variables.product.github %} and override the Gravatar image.

## Profile location and time zone

You can set a location and time zone on your profile to show other people your local time. Your location and time zone will be visible:
* On your profile page
* When people hover over your username or avatar

![Screenshot of the Octocat profile page emphasizing the location, local time, and relative time fields.](/assets/images/help/profile/profile-location-and-time.png)

When you view your profile, you will see your location, local time, and your time zone in relation to Universal Time Coordinated. When others view your profile, they will see your location, local time, and the time difference in hours from their own local time.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Displaying badges on your profile

When you participate in certain programs, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically displays a badge on your profile.

| Badge | Program | Description |

| {% octicon "cpu" aria-label="The Developer Program icon" %} | **Developer Program Member** | If you're a registered member of the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Developer Program, building an app with the {% data variables.product.github %} API, you'll get a Developer Program Member badge on your profile.

| {% octicon "star-fill" aria-label="The star icon" %} | **Pro** | If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %} you'll get a PRO badge on your profile. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-pro). |

For more information about the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Security program, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Security](https://bounty.github.com/). |
| {% octicon "mortar-board" aria-label="The mortar-board icon" %} | **{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Campus Expert** | If you participate in the {% data variables.product.prodname_campus_program %}, you will get a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Campus Expert badge on your profile. For more information about the Campus Experts program, see [Campus Experts](https://education.github.com/experts). |
| {% octicon "shield" aria-label="The shield icon" %} | **Security advisory credit** | If a security advisory you submit to the [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) is accepted, you'll get a Security advisory credit badge on your profile. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Security Advisories, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Security Advisories](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories). |

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Earning Achievements

Achievements celebrate specific events and actions that happen on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. They will appear as small badges listed in the sidebar of your profile. Clicking or hovering on an achievement will show a detailed view that hints at how the achievement was earned, with a short description and links to the contributing events. The event links will only be visible to users that have access to the repository or organization that the event took place in. Event links will appear inaccessible to all users without access.

To stop private contributions from counting toward your Achievements, or to turn off Achievements entirely, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/showing-your-private-contributions-and-achievements-on-your-profile).

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

## Profile name changes for {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}

If you're a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, any changes to your profile name must be made through your identity provider instead of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.emu-more-info-account %}

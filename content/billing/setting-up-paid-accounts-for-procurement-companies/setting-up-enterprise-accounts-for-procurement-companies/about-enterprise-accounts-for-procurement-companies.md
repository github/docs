## About enterprise accounts

An enterprise account allows your client to manage and enforce policies for multiple organizations. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts)."

To access an enterprise account, each member must sign into their own personal account. Enterprise members can have different roles, including owner and billing manager:

* Owners have complete administrative access to an enterprise.
* Billing managers can only manage billing settings, and cannot access enterprise resources.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise)."

Alternatively, you can set up a single organization for your client. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/setting-up-paid-accounts-for-procurement-companies/setting-up-paid-organizations-for-procurement-companies)."

## Payments and pricing for enterprise accounts

We don't provide quotes for pricing. You can see our published pricing on our [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing). We do not provide discounts for procurement companies or for renewal orders.

We accept payment in US dollars, although end users may be located anywhere in the world.

We accept payment by credit card and PayPal. We don't accept payment by purchase order or invoice.

For easier and more efficient purchasing, we recommend that procurement companies set up yearly billing for their clients' enterprise accounts.

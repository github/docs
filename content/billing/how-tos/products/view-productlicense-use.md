## Viewing a summary of usage

The options available to you vary according to your role and {% data variables.product.github %} plan.

{% data variables.product.github %} cloud:
* Anyone can view usage data for their own personal account unless their account is managed by their enterprise (EMU).
* If you are an **owner** or **billing manager** of an enterprise, or an organization on {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, you will also have access to usage data for that organization or enterprise account.

{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}:
* Enterprise owners can access and download usage data for licenses, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/how-tos/products/download-ghas-license-use).

### Personal accounts

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_billing_settings_url %}
1. Use the tabbed view to see a summary of consumed use for each product that you use (in this example, the "{% data variables.product.prodname_AS %}" tab is shown).

   ![Screenshot of the tabbed view showing "{% data variables.product.prodname_AS %}" with the "View details" links outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/billing/overview-product-summary.png)

1. Optionally, click **View details** to show more detailed information.

### Organization and enterprise accounts

1. Display the settings for the organization or enterprise account you want to view data for. For example, using the context switcher shown on all personal and organization account settings pages.

   ![Screenshot of the "Public profile" settings for The Octocat. Next to "Your personal profile," a "Switch settings context" link is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/settings/context-switcher-button.png)

1. Click **{% octicon "credit-card" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="credit-card" %} Billing & Licensing** to display the billing and licensing overview for the account:
   * **Organization** accounts: under "Access" in the sidebar for settings.
   * **Enterprise** accounts: a separate tab at the top of the page.

## Exploring usage data in more detail

You can also explore usage data in more detail in the **{% octicon "graph" aria-label="chart" aria-hidden="true" %} Usage** view.

* **Filter data on the page**: click in the text box to see a list of available filters.
* **Group data**: options in the "Group" option vary based on the filters you define.
* **Choose a time period**: use the "Time Frame" option.

The metered usage chart and usage break down table both show your current choice of data.

## Viewing a summary of usage

The options available to you vary according to your role and {% data variables.product.github %} plan.

{% data variables.product.github %} cloud:
* Anyone can view usage data for their own personal account unless their account is managed by their enterprise (EMU).
* If you are an **owner** or **billing manager** of an enterprise, or an organization on {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, you will also have access to usage data for that organization or enterprise account.

{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}:
* Enterprise owners can access and download usage data for licenses, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/how-tos/products/download-ghas-license-use).

### Personal accounts

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_billing_settings_url %}
1. Use the tabbed view to see a summary of consumed use for each product that you use (in this example, the "{% data variables.product.prodname_AS %}" tab is shown).

   ![Screenshot of the tabbed view showing "{% data variables.product.prodname_AS %}" with the "View details" links outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/billing/overview-product-summary.png)

1. Optionally, click **View details** to show more detailed information.

### Organization and enterprise accounts

1. Display the settings for the organization or enterprise account you want to view data for. For example, using the context switcher shown on all personal and organization account settings pages.

   ![Screenshot of the "Public profile" settings for The Octocat. Next to "Your personal profile," a "Switch settings context" link is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/settings/context-switcher-button.png)

1. Click **{% octicon "credit-card" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="credit-card" %} Billing & Licensing** to display the billing and licensing overview for the account:
   * **Organization** accounts: under "Access" in the sidebar for settings.
   * **Enterprise** accounts: a separate tab at the top of the page.

## Exploring usage data in more detail

You can also explore usage data for all metered products in more detail in the **Usage** or **Metered usage** view.

* **Filter data on the page**: click in the text box to see a list of available filters.
* **Group data**: options in the "Group" option vary based on the filters you define.
* **Choose a time period**: use the "Time Frame" option.

The metered usage chart and usage break down table both show your current choice of data.

{% endif %}

## Analyzing use of premium requests

{% data reusables.billing.premium-request-analytics-start %}

If you use premium requests, an additional **Premium request analytics** view is listed under **Usage**. You can use this view to dig deeper into how you are using included requests and where you are being billed for additional requests. For example:

* What's our total usage of premiums requests across all products?
* Are users making good use of the premium requests included in their license for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}?
* Which users have consumed more than their monthly quota?
* How widespread is adoption in the organizations where we rolled out {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}?

As you change the filter, "Timeframe", and "Group by", and options, all areas of the page are updated to reflect your choices. The chart shows the top 5 consumers and combines any other consumers into "All other".

![Screenshot of the premium request analytics chart, "Usage grouped by organization", and table. A "Show Usage Breakdown" arrow is outlined.](/assets/images/help/billing/premium-request-analytics-chart.png)

To show more detailed information for the top 100 users or organizations consuming premium requests, use the {% octicon "chevron-right" aria-label="Show Usage Breakdown" aria-hidden="true" %} shown at the start of each row to expand and collapse data.

## Downloading usage reports

Visit the "Metered Usage" page to access a metered billing report for all products, or navigate to the "Premium request analytics" page for a specialized report tailored for  Premium request activity tracking.

### General usage reports

1. At the top of the page, click **Get usage report**.
1. If prompted, specify the report details:
   * Metered usage page: in the dialog displayed, define details of the report that you want to download and click **Email me the report**.
   * Premium request analytics page: the report will contain usage for the last 45 days.

When the report is ready for you to download, you'll receive a message to your primary email account with a link to download the report. The link will expire after 24 hours.

For details of the fields included in the reports, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/reference/billing-reports).

### Downloading the data plotted in the chart

When the chart on the "Usage" or "Premium request analytics" page shows the data you want to download, click the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Chart options" aria-hidden="true" %} "Chart options" button and select your preferred format.

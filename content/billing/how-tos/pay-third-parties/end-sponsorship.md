You can set an end date to your sponsorship. The end date assigned will be the last date for which you will be charged for that sponsorship, but the sponsorship will show active for another month.

For example, if July 2025 is set as the end date, the last sponsorship will be charged in July 2025, but the sponsorship will be shown as active until August 2025. For more information about setting an end date to a new sponsorship, see [AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor).

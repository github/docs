## About usage-based billing

With the new billing platform, you pay monthly for the number of {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} licenses you use. You will not need to buy a predefined number of licenses in advance. Usage-based billing provides flexibility and cost savings compared to more traditional licensing models, such as volume or subscription models.

{% data reusables.billing.license-type-overview %}
{% data reusables.billing.license-models %}

{% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %} is currently not supported for usage-based billing.

## How are metered licenses measured?

{% data reusables.billing.metered-license-measures %}

## Which payment methods can I use?

You can use the following payment methods for usage-based billing for licenses:

* Invoiced and self-serve {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} customers can pay using a **credit card** or **PayPal**
* Invoiced customers can also pay using **prepaid credits** (only available to customers who have a volume subscription with or without metered add-ons)
* You can connect an **Azure** subscription to your enterprise account
* For **purchase orders**, you can contact your account manager in {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}

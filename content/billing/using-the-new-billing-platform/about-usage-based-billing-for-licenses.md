---

With the new billing platform, you pay monthly for the number of {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} licenses you use. You will not need to buy a predefined number of licenses in advance.

If a user starts consuming a license seat during the month, you will pay pro rata for the user's license usage that month. If a user stops consuming a license seat during the month, your bill for the following month will reflect the change.

Pending invitations to join an organization that belongs to your enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} do not consume a license.

{% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %} is currently not supported for usage-based billing.

## Which payment methods can I use?

You can use the following payment methods for usage-based billing for licenses:

* Invoiced and self-serve {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} customers can pay using a **credit card** or **PayPal**
* You can connect an **Azure** subscription to your enterprise
* For **purchase orders**, you can contact your account manager in {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}

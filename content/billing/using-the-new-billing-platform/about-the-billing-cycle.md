If your {% data variables.enterprise.enterprise_or_org %} {% ifversion fpt %}or personal account{% endif %} uses the enhanced billing platform, you have a fixed billing period for metered usage which runs from the first day of the month to the last day of the month. When the month ends, the usage is scheduled to be billed on your bill cycle day. Your bill cycle day {% ifversion fpt %}is the day you created your organization. For example, if you created the account{% elsif ghec %}is dictated by the moment you converted from a trial to a paid enterprise account.

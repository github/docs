>[!IMPORTANT] If you are on not on the new billing platform, this article does not apply to you. To check if you are on the new billing platform, see "[How do I know if I can access the enhanced billing platform?](/billing/using-the-new-billing-platform/about-the-new-billing-platform-for-enterprises#how-do-i-know-if-i-can-access-the-enhanced-billing-platform)." For more information about the billing cycle for your enterprise account, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/using-the-billing-platform/changing-the-duration-of-your-billing-cycle#changing-the-duration-of-your-enterprise-accounts-billing-cycle)."

If your enterprise is on the new billing platform, you have a fixed billing period for metered usage which runs from the first day of the month to the last day of the month. When the month ends, the usage is scheduled to be billed on your bill cycle day. Your bill cycle day is dictated by the moment you converted from a trial to a paid enterprise account. For example, if you converted on the fifteenth of the month, you will be billed on the fifteenth of each subsequent month.

This applies to all products available through the new billing platform.

The new billing platform provides a high-level view of your spending trends based on the usage across products. You can use this information to estimate your spending and make informed decisions about your budget.

## Viewing your spending

The "Overview" page provides a high-level view of your spending and budgets.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.billing.enterprise-billing-menu %}

On this page, you can view your usage in the following categories:

* **Current metered usage:** The card on the top left shows the gross metered usage for your enterprise including all cost centers. Click **More details** to view a breakdown of the usage by cost center.
* **Metered usage:** The graph shows the gross metered usage for your enterprise including cost centers.

   To view a different time period, select **Time Frame**, then choose a time period. You can also download an image of the graph by clicking {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Open column options" %} on the right.

* **By organization** and **by repository:** The two cards under the graph show the top five organizations and repositories that generate the most usage. You can click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Open column options" %} in the upper-right corner of each card to view all usage.
* **By products:** You can use the product tabs to view usage and discounts for different products. Only products with usage are shown.

   {% endif %}

## Viewing promotion and discounts

In the "Current promotions and discounts" section in the top right, you can see the total amount of promotions and discounts applied to your account. Click **More details** to view a breakdown of the promotions and discounts.

## Tracking budgets

At the bottom of the page, under "Budgets", you can see budgets you have set, and how much you have spent against those budgets. By clicking {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Open column options" %} to the right of a budget, you can edit or delete the budget.

If you have used all of your budget, a red banner appears at the top of the page. You can click **Update your budget** to increase your budget.

If you don't already have access to the new billing platform, there are three ways to get started.

* If you are **new** to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, set up a trial of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud)."
* If you have an **existing** enterprise account and pay by **invoice**, contact your account manager in {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %} to discuss switching when your contract renews.
* If you have an **existing** enterprise account and pay via **credit card or PayPal**, wait for an in-product prompt to transition.

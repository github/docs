Budgets and alerts allow you to track spending for your {% ifversion fpt %}organization{% elsif ghec %}enterprise, organizations, repositories, or cost centers{% endif %}. By setting a monthly budget, you can monitor your spending and receive notifications by email when your spending exceeds certain preset percentages of your budget threshold. This can help you stay within your budget and avoid overspending.

The budget only applies to expenses incurred from the date of its creation onwards. Any expenses incurred prior to the creation of the budget will not be included in the calculations

Budgets are not applicable to:

* {% ifversion enterprise-licensing-language %}License{% else %}Seat{% endif %}-based products such as {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}{% ifversion fpt %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}{% elsif ghec %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}.
* Pre-paid volume licenses{% endif %}.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, paid usage will be limited to $0 for accounts that do not have a payment method on file. For accounts that do have a payment method on file, the default budget is unlimited.

## Viewing budgets

If you are an {% data variables.enterprise.enterprise_or_org %} owner or billing manager, your {% data variables.enterprise.enterprise_or_org %}'s budget will be listed at the top of the "Budgets and alerts" page{% ifversion ghec %}, followed by the budgets for your organizations and cost centers. As an organization owner, you will be able to view the budgets for your organizations, repositories, and cost centers{% endif %}.

{% ifversion fpt %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.billing.org-billing-menu %}

{% elsif ghec %}

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.billing.enterprise-billing-menu %}

{% endif %}

## Creating a budget

As an {% data variables.enterprise.enterprise_or_org %} owner{% ifversion ghec %} or billing manager{% endif %}, you can set the budget for your {% data variables.enterprise.enterprise_or_org %}{% ifversion ghec %}, an organization within your enterprise, or a cost center. As an organization owner, you are able to set the budgets for the repositories you manage{% endif %}.

{% ifversion fpt %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.billing.org-billing-menu %}

{% elsif ghec %}

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.billing.enterprise-billing-menu %}

{% endif %}

1. Click **New budget**.
1. Under "Products", select the metered product to include in this budget.
1. Under "Budget scope", set the scope of spending for this budget.

   To stop any usage and further spending once your {% ifversion fpt %}organization{% elsif ghec %}enterprise or organization{% endif %} reaches the budget limit, select **Stop usage when budget limit is reached**. This does not apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} usage.

   >[!IMPORTANT] If you do not select **Stop usage when budget limit is reached**, you will be notified by email if you exceed your budget, but usage **will not** be stopped.

1. To receive an alert if your budget has reached 75%, 90% and 100% thresholds, select **Receive budget threshold alerts** under "Alerts". When the budget has reached the specific threshold, you will be notified via email and a banner on {% data variables.product.github %}. You may opt out at any time.

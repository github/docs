You can view your payment information and history, and update your billing contacts. Supported payment methods include:

* Credit card
* PayPal
* Azure Subscription ID

{% ifversion fpt %}

## Connecting your Azure subscription

You must know your Azure subscription ID. For more information, see the following documentation or [contact Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

* [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription)
* [Get subscription and tenant IDs in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id) in the Microsoft Docs

{% elsif ghec %}

## Prerequisites for paying through Azure

* You must be new to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} to begin with usage-based billing through an Azure subscription. If your company already uses {% data variables.product.github %}, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_importer_proper_name %} to migrate your resources to a new subscription that bills through Azure. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/understanding-github-enterprise-importer/about-github-enterprise-importer).
* Prepaid usage is not currently available for usage-based billing through Azure.
* You must know your Azure subscription ID. For more information, see the following documentation or [contact Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

  * [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription)
  * [Get subscription and tenant IDs in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id) in the Microsoft Docs

## Connecting your Azure subscription

After creation of your new enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, to begin usage-based billing through Azure, you must connect your Azure subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT] If you don't use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, connection of an Azure subscription will immediately end your trial and begin paid usage.

For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription#connecting-your-azure-subscription-to-your-enterprise-account).

## What does my Azure invoice look like?

After you connect your Azure subscription, usage for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s products will appear on your Azure invoice, summarized by product family.

For example, if you use this billing arrangement for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, usage and price excluding tax for each line item will appear as follows.

| Product Family Usage Charges | Total (excluding Tax) |
| :- | :- |
| GH ENTERPRISE | AMOUNT |
| GH ADVANCED SECURITY | AMOUNT |

For more information about your Azure invoice, see [Understand terms on your Microsoft Azure invoice](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/understand-invoice) in the Microsoft Docs.

The {% data variables.product.company_short %} products on your Azure invoice are also MACC-eligible. For more information, see [Track your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/track-consumption-commitment) in the Microsoft Docs.

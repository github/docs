You can unlock and access your account by updating your account's payment method and resuming paid status. We do not ask you to pay for the time elapsed in locked mode.

You can downgrade your user account or organization to {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} to continue with the same advanced features in public repositories. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan).

## Unlocking an organization's features due to a declined payment

If your account's advanced features are locked due to a declined payment, you'll need to update your billing information to trigger a newly authorized charge. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/articles/adding-or-editing-a-payment-method).

If the new billing information is approved, we will immediately charge you for the paid product you chose. The account will automatically unlock when a payment has been successfully processed. Payments may take up to 24 hours to process.

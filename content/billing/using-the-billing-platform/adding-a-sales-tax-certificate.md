If you're a {% data variables.product.company_short %} customer in the United States, you need to ensure that your account is set up to calculate sales tax correctly. If you're exempt from sales tax, you can upload a certificate to your account. The format of the certificate you upload must be one of the following:

* JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
* PNG (`.png`)
* PDF (`.pdf`)

Your account is marked as tax exempt while your certificate is reviewed. If your certificate is not approved, you will need to upload a new one.

## Migrating between Copilot plans

When transitioning between different GitHub Copilot plans, you may encounter situations that require support from us. 

### Migrations requiring support assistance

Some migrations cannot be completed through self-service options:

- **Non-GHE to GHE environment migrations**: When moving from standalone Copilot subscriptions to a GitHub Enterprise environment, contact GitHub Support or your account manager for assistance to avoid service interruption or double billing.  
    
- **Changing between Copilot for Business and Copilot Enterprise**: If you need to migrate between these plans within your enterprise and the option isn't available in your Billing & Licensing settings, contact GitHub Support or your account manager for assistance.

### Trial expiration notices

If you're seeing an expired trial notice despite having an active paid subscription, this display issue doesn't affect your current paid access. If this persists, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com) for assistance.

## Prerequisites

* Your team's {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscription must include {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}. For more information, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} Subscriptions and Benefits](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) on the {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} website and [Overview of admin responsibilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/admin-responsibilities) in Microsoft Docs.

* Your team must have an enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. If you're not sure whether your team has an enterprise, contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} administrator. If you're not sure who on your team is responsible for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts).

## Setting up {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %}

To set up {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %}, members of your team must complete the following tasks.

One person may be able to complete the tasks because the person has all of the roles, but you may need to coordinate the tasks with multiple people. For more information, see [Roles for {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %}](#roles-for-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise).

1. An enterprise owner must create at least one organization in your enterprise on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise).

1. The subscription admin must assign a license for {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} to a subscriber in {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_admin_portal_with_url %}. For more information, see [Overview of the {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} Subscriptions Administrator Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/using-admin-portal) and [Assign {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} Licenses in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} Subscriptions Administration Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-license) in Microsoft Docs.

1. Optionally, if the subscription admin assigned licenses to subscribers in {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} before adding {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} to the subscription, the subscription admin can move the subscribers to the combined offering in the {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} administration portal. For more information, see [Manage {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscriptions with {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/assign-github#moving-to-visual-studio-with-github-enterprise) in Microsoft Docs.

1. If the subscription admin has not disabled email notifications, the subscriber will receive two confirmation emails. For more information, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} subscriptions with {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/access-github#what-is-the-visual-studio-subscription-with-github-enterprise-setup-process) in Microsoft Docs.

1. An organization owner must invite the subscriber to the organization on {% data variables.location.product_location %} from step 1. The subscriber can accept the invitation with an existing personal account or create a new account. After the subscriber joins the organization, the subscriber becomes an enterprise member. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).

   > [!TIP]
   > * While not required, we recommend that the organization owner sends an invitation to the same email address used for the subscriber's User Primary Name (UPN). When the email address on {% data variables.location.product_location %} matches the subscriber's UPN, you can ensure that another enterprise does not claim the subscriber's license.
   > * If the subscriber accepts the invitation to the organization with an existing personal account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, we recommend that the subscriber add the email address they use for {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} to their personal account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).
   > * If the organization owner must invite a large number of subscribers, a script may make the process faster. For more information, see [the sample PowerShell script](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/blob/master/api/powershell/invite_members_to_org.ps1) in the `github/platform-samples` repository.

After {% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %} is set up for subscribers on your team, enterprise owners can review licensing information on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/viewing-the-subscription-and-usage-for-your-enterprise-account).

If you are an organization owner{% ifversion ghec %} or enterprise owner{% endif%}, you can connect an Azure Subscription ID to your organization {% ifversion ghec %}or enterprise{% endif%} account to enable and pay for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage beyond the amounts included with your account. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription)."

Minutes reset every month, while storage usage does not.

### Included storage and minutes

> [!NOTE]
> * Included minutes cannot be used for larger runners. These runners will always be charged for, including in public repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#per-minute-rates)."
> * Logs and job summaries do not count towards storage usage.

|Plan | Storage | Minutes (per month)|
|------- | ------- | ---------|
| {% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %} | 500 MB | 2,000 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_pro %} | 1 GB | 3,000 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for organizations | 500 MB | 2,000 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} | 2 GB | 3,000 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} | 50 GB | 50,000 |

The storage used by a repository is the total storage used by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} artifacts and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. Your storage cost is the total usage for all repositories owned by your account. For more information about pricing for  {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-packages/about-billing-for-github-packages)."

If your account's usage surpasses these limits and you have set a spending limit above $0 USD, you will pay $0.008 USD per GB of storage per day and per-minute usage depending on the operating system used by the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} rounds the minutes and partial minutes each job uses up to the nearest whole minute.

### Minute multipliers

Jobs that run on Windows and macOS runners that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} hosts consume minutes at 2 and 10 times the rate that jobs on Linux runners consume. For example, using 1,000 Windows minutes would consume 2,000 of the minutes included in your account. Using 1,000 macOS minutes, would consume 10,000 minutes included in your account.

| Operating system | Minute multiplier |
|----------------- | ------------------|
| Linux            | 1                 |
| Windows          | 2                 |
| macOS            | 10                |

> [!NOTE]
> Minute multipliers do not apply to the per-minute rates shown below.

#### Points to note about rates for runners

* The number of jobs you can run concurrently across all repositories in your user or organization account depends on your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration)" for {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#usage-limits)" for self-hosted runner usage limits.

## Calculating minute and storage spending

{% data reusables.dotcom_billing.pricing_calculator.pricing_cal_actions %}

At the end of the month, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} calculates the cost of minutes and storage used over the amount included in your account.

### Sample minutes cost calculation

For example, if your organization uses {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} and allows unlimited spending, using 5,000 minutes could have a total storage and minute overage cost of $56 USD, depending on the operating systems used to run jobs.

* 5,000 (3,000 Linux and 2,000 Windows) minutes = $56 USD ($24 USD + $32 USD).
  * 3,000 Linux minutes at $0.008 USD per minute = $24 USD.
  * 2,000 Windows minutes at $0.016 USD per minute = $32 USD.

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} calculates your storage usage for each month based on hourly usage during that month.

### Sample storage cost calculation

> [!NOTE]
> {% data variables.product.company_short %} updates your storage space within a 6 to 12-hour window. If you delete artifacts, the available space will be reflected in your account during the next scheduled update.

For example, if you use 3 GB of storage for 10 days of March and 12 GB for 21 days of March, your storage usage would be:

* 3 GB x 10 days x (24 hours per day) = 720 GB-Hours
* 12 GB x 21 days x (24 hours per day) = 6,048 GB-Hours
* 720 GB-Hours + 6,048 GB-Hours = 6,768 GB-Hours
* 6,768 GB-Hours / (744 hours per month) = 9.0967 GB-Months

At the end of the month, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} rounds your storage to the nearest MB. Therefore, your storage usage for March would be 9.097 GB.

Your {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage shares your account's existing billing date, payment method, and receipt. {% data reusables.dotcom_billing.view-all-subscriptions %}

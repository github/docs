## Metered billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}

If you started a trial of {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} during your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} trial on or after August 1, 2024, or if your account is onboarded into metered billing outside of the trial, your billing will be usage-based. This means:

* You pay for the number of licenses used each month.
* This applies to both {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}.

There are a few key differences between metered and volume billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}.

* **Metered billing:**

  * Billed per active committer, with no pre-defined license limit.
  * No overage state, pay only for what you use.

* **Volume billing:**

  * Purchase a defined number of licenses (e.g. 100 licenses).
  * If usage exceeds purchased licenses, you will need to purchase additional licenses to cover this overage usage.

### Managing committers and repositories

{% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is billed per committer and enabled by repository. If a committer is removed from an organization or enterprise, they are no longer billable as of the removal day. However, if you disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} on a repository, the committers tied to that repository will remain billable until the end of the current monthly billing cycle. Prorated billing applies if a committer starts partway through the month. For an example of how this works, see "[Understanding usage](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security#understanding-usage)."

If you have further questions about using {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, you can contact your account manager in {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}.

## License size

{% ifversion metered-ghe-ghas %}

> [!IMPORTANT] If you have access to usage-based billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, you will pay for the licenses you use each month and will not have a license limit. See "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/using-the-enhanced-billing-platform-for-enterprises/about-usage-based-billing-for-licenses)."

{% endif %}

Each license for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} specifies a maximum number of accounts that can use these features. Each active committer to at least one repository with the feature enabled uses one {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}license{% else %}seat{% endif %}. A committer is considered active if one of their commits has been pushed to the repository within the last 90 days, regardless of when it was originally authored.

When you remove a user from your enterprise account, the user's license is freed within 24 hours.

{% ifversion ghes %}
You can determine how many licenses you'll need for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} by generating a count of your instance's active committers in the site admin dashboard. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/site-admin-dashboard#advanced-security-committers)."
{% endif %}

If you are over your license limit, {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} continues to work on all repositories where it is already enabled. However, in organizations where {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is enabled for new repositories, repositories will be created with the feature deactivated. In addition, the option to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for existing repositories will not be available.

As soon as you free up some {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}licenses{% else %}seats{% endif %}, by deactivating {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for some repositories or by increasing your license size, the options for activating {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} will work again as normal.

You can enforce policies to allow or disallow the use of {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} by organizations owned by your enterprise account. See "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-advanced-security-in-your-enterprise)."

## Active committers and unique committers

We record and display two numbers of {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}active {% endif %}committers for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} on {% data variables.location.product_location %}:

* **{% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}Active committers{% else %}Committers{% endif %}** is the number of committers who contributed to at least one {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}private {% endif %}organization-owned repository{% ifversion secret-scanning-user-owned-repos %} or one user-owned repository{% ifversion ghec %} when using {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}{% endif %}{% endif %}, and who use a {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}license {% else %}seat {% endif %}in your enterprise. That is, they are also an organization member, an external collaborator, or have a pending invitation to join an organization in your enterprise, and they are not a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} bot. For information about differences between bot and machine accounts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps#machine-vs-bot-accounts)."
* **Unique to this repository/organization** is the number of {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}active {% endif %}committers who contributed only to this repository, or to repositories in this organization. This number shows how many {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}licenses {% else %}seats {% endif %}you can free up by deactivating {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for that repository or organization.

If there are no unique {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}active {% endif %}committers, all active committers also contribute to other repositories or organizations that use {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}. Deactivating the feature for that repository or organization would not free any {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}licenses{% else %}seats{% endif %} for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}.

> [!NOTE] Users can contribute to multiple repositories or organizations. Usage is measured across the whole enterprise account to ensure that each member uses one {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}license {% else %}seat {% endif %}regardless of how many repositories or organizations the user contributes to.

When you activate or deactivate {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %} for repositories, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} displays an overview of changes to the use of your license. If you deactivate access to {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, any {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}licenses{% else %}seats{% endif %} used by unique active committers are freed up.

{% ifversion ghec %}
For more information on managing the number of committers, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/managing-your-github-advanced-security-licensing)."

## Understanding usage

{% ifversion metered-ghe-ghas %}

The following example timeline demonstrates how active committer count for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} could change over time in an enterprise. For each month, you will find events, along with the resulting committer count and the effect on usage-based billing.

| Date | Events during the month | Total committers | Effect on usage-based billing |
| :- | :- | -: | :- |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">April 15</span> | A member of your enterprise enables {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for repository **X**. Repository **X** has 50 committers over the past 90 days. | **50** | Billing begins for 50 committers. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">May 1</span> | Developer **A** leaves the team working on repository **X**. Developer **A**'s contributions continue to count for 90 days. | **50** | No immediate change. Developer **A** continues to be billed until their contributions are inactive for 90 days. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">August 1</span> | Developer **A**'s contributions no longer count towards the licenses required, because 90 days have passed. | 50 - 1 =<br>**49** | Developer **A** is removed from the billing count, reducing the billable committers to 49. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">August 15</span> | A member of your enterprise enables {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for a second repository, repository **Y**. In the last 90 days, a total of 20 developers contributed to that repository. Of those 20 developers, 10 also recently worked on repo **X** and do not require additional licenses. | 49 + 10 =<br>**59** | Billing increases to 59 committers, accounting for the 10 additional unique contributors. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">August 16</span> | A member of your enterprise disables {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for repository **X**. Of the 49 developers who were working on repository **X**, 10 still also work on repository **Y**, which has a total of 20 developers contributing in the last 90 days. | 49 - 29 =<br>**20** | Billing for repository **X** continues until the end of the monthly billing cycle, but the overall billing count decreases to 20 committers for the next cycle. |

## Getting the most out of {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}

When you decide which repositories and organizations to prioritize for {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}, you should review them and identify:

* Codebases that are the most critical to your company's success. These are the projects for which the introduction of vulnerable code, hard-coded secrets, or insecure dependencies would have the greatest impact on your company.
* Codebases with the highest commit frequency. These are the most actively developed projects, consequently there is a higher risk that security problems could be introduced.

When you have enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} for these organizations or repositories, assess which other codebases you could add without incurring billing for unique {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}active {% endif %}committers. Finally, review the remaining important and busy codebases. If you want to increase the number of {% ifversion ghas-billing-UI-update %}licensed active committers, {% else %}seats in your license, {% endif %}contact {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}.

{% ifversion ghas-in-license-sync %}
If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} on both {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you can ensure users aren't consuming multiple licenses unnecessarily by synchronizing license usage between environments.{% ifversion ghec %} {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is included in license sync in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} version 3.12 and later.{% endif %} See "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-license-for-github-enterprise/syncing-license-usage-between-github-enterprise-server-and-github-enterprise-cloud)."

## About billing for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}

{% data reusables.large_files.free-storage-bandwidth-amount %} {% data reusables.large_files.does_not_carry %}

{% data reusables.large_files.owner_quota_only %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.context_switcher %}

## Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth

Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_price %}, and provides a monthly quota of {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_bandwidth %} for bandwidth and {% data variables.large_files.pack_monthly_storage %} for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs. For more information about how to purchase additional storage and bandwidth, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/upgrading-git-large-file-storage)."

Purchasing data packs for {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} is independent of any other paid feature or product on {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

## Downgrading storage and bandwidth

If you downgrade your number of additional data packs, your changes will take effect on your next billing date.

## About connection of an Azure subscription

You can pay for usage of {% data variables.product.product_name %} features through Azure by connecting an Azure Subscription ID to your organization {% ifversion ghec %}or enterprise{% endif%} account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. {% ifversion fpt %}For more information about organization accounts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)."{% elsif ghec %}

In this article, the instructions that you must follow to connect an Azure subscription depend on whether your company uses a single organization or an enterprise account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. For more information about the differences between these two types of accounts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}

If you use {% data variables.product.product_name %} through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, connection to an Azure subscription is the only way to use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %}, or to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} beyond your plan's included amounts.

## About billing through Azure

If you link your {% data variables.product.company_short %} account to Azure, any usage-based costs starting from that point will be billed through Azure and charged on the 1st of each month. However, remaining {% data variables.product.company_short %} charges, for example charges for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan, will still be billed on your usual billing date.

For example, you link your Azure subscription to your organization {% ifversion ghec %}or enterprise{% endif%} account on June 16th and you also have a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_for_business %} subscription. From that date onwards, any usage costs for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %} will be included in your Azure bill and charged on July 1st. However, any charges incurred before June 16th for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %} will be billed separately through {% data variables.product.company_short %} on your account's usual billing date.

## Prerequisites

* You must have {% ifversion ghec %}either {% endif %}an organization {% ifversion ghec %}or an enterprise {% endif %}account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. For more information about the differences between these two types of accounts, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

  If the organization you want to connect an Azure subscription to belongs to an enterprise account, you must connect your Azure subscription to the enterprise account, not the organization. {% ifversion fpt %}See [the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} version](/enterprise-cloud@latest/{{ currentArticle }}) of this article.{% endif %}

* You must be an owner of the organization{% ifversion ghec %} or enterprise{% endif %} account. See {% ifversion fpt %}"[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."{% elsif ghec %}the following articles.

  * "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)"
  * "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise)"
    {% endif %}

* You must be logged into Azure as a user who is able to provide tenant-wide admin consent, which is required to install {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Subscription Permission Validation app on the Azure AD tenant. The app requires read access to display a list of available subscriptions, and is only used during this one-time process of connecting the Azure subscription. See [Grant tenant-wide admin consent to an application](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent) in Microsoft Docs.

  * Alternatively, before following the instructions in this article, users who are not able to provide tenant-wide admin consent can work with an Azure AD global administrator to configure an admin consent workflow. See [User and admin consent in Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-admin-consent-overview#admin-consent-workflow) in Microsoft Docs.

     >[!NOTE] If your tenant provides user consent settings, users included in those settings might not require admin consent to install {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Subscription Permission Validation app. See [User consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview#user-consent) in Microsoft Docs.

* To select an Azure subscription from the list of available subscriptions, the user must be an owner of the Azure subscription. See [Assign a user as an administrator of an Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin) in Microsoft docs.

* You must know your Azure subscription ID. See [Get subscription and tenant IDs in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id) in the Microsoft Docs or [contact Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/).

## Troubleshooting connection of an Azure subscription

You can troubleshoot some common issues with connection of an Azure subscription to your account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

### Message: "Need admin approval"

If the user account you used to sign into Azure does not have adequate permissions to install the app that {% data variables.product.company_short %} uses to connect a subscription, you'll see a message with the following text.

> **Need admin approval**
>
> GitHub Inc needs permission to access resources in your organisation that only an admin can grant. Please ask an admin to grant permission to this app before you can use it.

To avoid this message when you try again, you must either ensure that the Azure user can provide tenant-wide admin consent, or you must work with an Azure administrator to configure the admin consent workflow. For more information, review "[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)."

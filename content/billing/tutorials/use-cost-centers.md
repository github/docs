>[!NOTE] Before you create or update a cost center, if you're unsure of how spending will be allocated to the cost center, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/reference/cost-center-allocation).

## Creating a cost center

> [!NOTE]
> An enterprise can create up to 250 cost centers.

Create cost centers to monitor and manage expenses for specific organizations or repositories. Multiple organizations, repositories, and users can be assigned to one cost center.

When you create a cost center, you can add **organizations**, **repositories**, or **users**. The cost center will then track spending for the selected entities.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.billing.enterprise-billing-menu %}
1. Click **Cost centers**.
1. Click **New cost center** in the upper-right corner.
1. In the text box under "Name", enter a name for your cost center.
1. If your account is billed to Azure, you have the option to add an Azure ID. Your credentials will be verified against Azure to ensure the Azure IDs associated to your account are available.
1. Under **Resources**, select the organizations, repositories, and/or users that will be a part of the cost center.

   >[!NOTE] A resource (organization, repository, or user) can only be assigned to one cost center at a time. If you add a resource that belongs to a different cost center, it will be moved to the new cost center and you will be notified.

1. Click **Create cost center**.

## Adding a budget to a cost center

After you create a cost center, you can add a monthly budget and receive alerts from the cost center to monitor your spending and usage. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-billing/using-budgets-control-spending).

## Viewing cost center usage

You can view the usage of your cost centers and download the usage data for further analysis. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/using-the-enhanced-billing-platform-for-enterprises/gathering-insights-on-your-spending).

## Viewing, editing, and deleting cost centers

You can view, edit, and delete cost centers to manage your business units effectively.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.access-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.billing.enterprise-billing-menu %}
1. Click **Cost centers**.
1. Select {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Cost center dropdown" %} to the right of a cost center, then click **View details**, **Edit**, or **Delete**.
1. Follow the prompts.

## Limitations of the cost center API

There are a few current limitations when working with cost centers and the API:

* There is a maximum of 250 cost centers per enterprise.
* You can add or remove up to 50 resources at a time from a cost center using the API.
* Azure subscriptions can only be added to or removed from cost centers through the UI.

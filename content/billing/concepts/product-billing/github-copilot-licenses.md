## How usage of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licenses is measured

For details on billing and proration, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/billing/billing-for-individuals).

### Organizations and enterprises

* If a user has seats in multiple organizations within the same enterprise, the enterprise is only billed once per cycle.
* If both a {% data variables.copilot.copilot_business_short %} and a {% data variables.copilot.copilot_enterprise_short %} seat are assigned, only the enterprise seat is billed.

For more information about seat assignment, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/seat-assignment).

* Additional seats are billed immediately on a prorated basis for the rest of the current billing cycle.

## How use of {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} is measured

{% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} usage is **free** for **public packages**. In addition, data transferred in from any source is free.

For **private** repositories, each {% data variables.product.github %} account receives a quota of storage and data transfer for use with {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}, depending on the account's plan. Any usage beyond the included amounts is billed to your account. Data transfer resets every month, while storage usage does not.

Working in a private repository with packages:

* When you **publish a private package**, the total file size is included in the **repository owner's storage use**.
* When you **download** a private package, the transfer of data is included in the **repository owner's data transfer usage**.

> [!TIP]
> Anyone with write access to a repository can publish packages without increasing usage for their personal account.

### Examples of how usage is measured

* If you publish a 500 MB package in a private repository, you'll use 500 MB of the repository owner's storage and none of their data transfer allowance. If you find a bug and publish an updated 500 MB package without deleting the original package, you are now using 1 GB of the owner's storage.
* If you download a 500 MB package from a private repository, you'll use 500 MB of the repository owner's data transfer. If a security fix is released and you download the new package, you'll add another 500 MB of data transfer, bringing the total transfer for these two downloads to 1 GB of data.
* If {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} downloads a 500 MB package from a private repository using a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, this does not count against the repository owner's data transfer allowance, see [Package downloads by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](#package-downloads-by-github-actions).

## Free use of {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}

The following amounts of storage and data transfer are included in your {% data variables.product.github %} plan. At the start of each month, the data transfer for the account is reset to zero.

{% rowheaders %}

Plan | Storage | Data transfer (per month)
------- | ------- | ---------
{% data variables.product.prodname_free_user %} | 500MB | 1GB
{% data variables.product.prodname_pro %} | 2GB | 10GB
{% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} for organizations | 500MB | 1GB |
{% data variables.product.prodname_team %} | 2GB | 10GB
{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} | 50GB | 100GB

{% endrowheaders %}

### Package downloads by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

When a workflow uses {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to download a package, the data transfer does not count against the usage for the hosting repository. We determine you are downloading packages using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} when you log in to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} using a `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

{% rowheaders %}

||Hosted|Self-Hosted|
|-|-|-|
|Access using a `GITHUB_TOKEN`|Free|Free|
|Access using a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}|Free|Paid|

{% endrowheaders %}

## Using more than your included quota

If your account does not have a valid payment method on file, usage is blocked once you use up your quota.

## Paying for additional {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} use

You pay for any additional use above your quota using the payment method set up for your {% data variables.product.github %} account. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/how-tos/set-up-payment/manage-payment-info).

Data transfer is billed for each GB of data transfered. Storage is billed by calculating an hourly usage rate.

* {% data reusables.dotcom_billing.pricing_calculator.pricing_cal_packages %}
* To view your current storage and bandwidth, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/viewing-your-product-usage).

### Example of how usage is calculated over a month

At the end of the month, {% data variables.product.github %} rounds your data transfer to the nearest GB.

{% data variables.product.github %} calculates your storage usage for each month based on hourly usage per GB during that month. For example, if you use 3 GB of storage for 10 days of March and 12 GB for 21 days of March, your storage usage would be:

* 3 GB x 10 days x (24 hours per day) = 720 GB-Hours
* 12 GB x 21 days x (24 hours per day) = 6,048 GB-Hours
* 720 GB-Hours + 6,048 GB-Hours = 6,768 total GB-Hours
* 6,768 GB-Hours / (744 hours per month) = 9.0967 GB-Months

At the end of the month, {% data variables.product.github %} rounds your storage to the nearest MB. Therefore, your storage usage for March would be 9.097 GB.

### Example of estimating usage

You can also use this calculation in the middle of a billing cycle, to estimate what your total usage might be for the month. For example, if you have an organization that uses {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, which provides 2 GB of free storage, and you use 0 GB for the first 5 days of April, 1.5 GB for the following 10 days, and you plan to use 3 GB for the last 15 days of the billing cycle, your projected storage usage for the month would be:

* 0 GB x 5 days x (24 hours per day) =   0 GB-Hours
* 0.5 GB x 10 days x (24 hours per day) = 120 GB-Hours
* 3 GB x 15 days x (24 hours per day) = 1080 GB-Hours
* 0 GB-Hours + 120 GB-Hours + 1080 GB-Hours = 1200 total GB-Hours
* 1200 GB-Hours / (744 hours per month) = 1.6 GB-Months

The projected 1.6 GB of storage usage for the month would not exceed your 2 GB limit, even though your actual storage amount exceeded 2 GB for half the month.

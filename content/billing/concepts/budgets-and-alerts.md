Budgets and alerts allow you to track spending on metered products for your enterprise, organizations, cost centers (enterprise only), and repositories. Budgets and alerts are not available for pre-paid volume licenses.

By setting a monthly budget, you can monitor your spending and receive notifications by email when your spending exceeds certain preset percentages of your budget threshold. This can help you stay within your budget and avoid overspending.

Many accounts already have default budgets for certain products. {% data reusables.billing.migrated-budgets %}

## Stopping usage

For license-based products such as {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_AS %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}, setting a budget does not prevent usage over the budget amount but does provide alerts.

For metered products such as {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} premium requests, you can choose for budgets to prevent usage once the budget amount is reached.

## Types and scopes

Each budget has a type and a scope that define which paid use contributes to spending against the budget.

* **Type**: Defines which metered product or SKU is measured.
* **Scope**: Defines whether the budget applies to the whole account, or to a subset of repositories, organizations, or cost centers (enterprise only).

## Your first billing cycle after creating a budget

When you first create a budget, be aware that the budget applies only to metered usage from the date of its creation onwards. Any use made before you created the budget is not included in the calculations. This means that you may exceed your budget in the first billing cycle after you create your budget, even if you select the option stop usage when the limit is reached.

## Set up a budget

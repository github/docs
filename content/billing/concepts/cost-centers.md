You can create cost centers to attribute usage and spending to business units, improving accountability, forecasting, and cost allocation.

If your account is billed through Azure, you can add an Azure subscription to a cost center to bill usage to a different Azure subscription than the enterprise default.

To get started with cost centers, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/tutorials/use-cost-centers).

## Cost center allocation

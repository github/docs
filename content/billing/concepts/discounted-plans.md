Verified academic faculty can apply for {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} for teaching or academic research. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/free-pro-team@latest/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education).

## Discounts for nonprofits and libraries

{% data variables.product.company_short %} provides free {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} for organizations with unlimited private repositories, unlimited collaborators, and a full feature set, or 25% off GitHub Enterprise Cloud to qualifying 501(c)3 (or equivalent) organizations and libraries. You can request a discount for your organization on [our nonprofit page](https://nonprofits.github.com/).

{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} customers can use Azure DevOps without additional costs per user. For customers using Microsoft Entra, users can sign in with the same credentials on {% data variables.product.github %} and Azure DevOps.

No additional setup is required. {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} users are detected automatically when they sign in to Azure DevOps. See [User and permissions management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/faq-user-and-permissions-management?view=azure-devops#github-enterprise) in the Microsoft Learn documentation.

Combined use is not currently available with {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency %}, but this is planned as a future improvement.

With usage-based billing, you pay monthly for the number of {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_cs_and_sp %} licenses you use. You do not need to buy a predefined number of licenses in advance.

Usage-based billing for licenses provides flexibility and cost savings compared to more traditional licensing models, such as volume or subscription models.

## Do I have usage-based billing?

{% data reusables.billing.do-i-have-usage-based %}

{% data variables.visual_studio.prodname_vss_ghe %} is currently not supported for usage-based billing.

## Can I use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}?

Although you can sync licenses with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, usage-based licensing is a cloud-first license model where users must first be added to an organization on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}.

For a detailed comparison between usage-based and volume licensing models, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/enterprise-billing/combined-enterprise-use#about-licensing-models).

## How are metered licenses measured?

{% data reusables.billing.metered-license-measures %}

## Which payment methods can I use?

You can use the following payment methods for usage-based billing for licenses:

* Invoiced and self-serve {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} customers can pay using a **credit card** or **PayPal**
* Invoiced customers can also pay using **prepaid credits** (only available to customers who have a volume subscription with or without metered add-ons)
* You can connect an **Azure** subscription to your enterprise account
* For **purchase orders**, you can contact your account manager in {% data variables.contact.contact_enterprise_sales %}

This article describes the billing model for {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} from the sponsor’s point of view.

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %}

## What a sponsorship billing entry represents

A sponsorship is a monetary commitment you make to a sponsored developer or organization through {% data variables.product.github %}. Each active recurring sponsorship produces a charge on its renewal date; one‑time sponsorships produce a single charge. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors).

## Unified payment method and billing date

Your sponsorships use the same stored payment method as your other paid products for the relevant personal account or organization. They follow the existing billing date/cycle for that account.

You can review active sponsorships alongside other paid subscriptions for the account to understand total ongoing commitments and historical charges.

If you sponsor from multiple accounts (personal vs organization), each account’s sponsorship charges stay separate and align with that account’s own billing cycle.

## Fees

{% data reusables.sponsors.no-fees %}

## Privacy

Sponsored parties see sponsorship details required for recognition or fulfillment, not your underlying payment method details.

## How sponsorship billing works

1. You create a one‑time or recurring sponsorship at a chosen amount (tier or custom amount if permitted).
1. The amount is charged (immediately for one‑time, and on each renewal cycle for recurring).
1. Changes to amount or cancelation affect future cycles (the current paid period continues until the next renewal unless you selected a one‑time sponsorship).
1. Ended sponsorships stop appearing as future charges but remain in historical billing records.

Proration is generally not part of sponsorship billing: changing an amount updates future renewals rather than retroactively adjusting the in‑progress period.

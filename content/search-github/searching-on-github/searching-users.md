{% data reusables.search.syntax_tips %}

## Search only users or organizations

By default, searching users will return both personal and organizations. However, you can use the `type` qualifier to restrict search results to personal accounts or organizations only.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `type:user` | [**mike in:name created:&lt;2011-01-01 type:user**](https://github.com/search?q=mike+in:name+created%3A%3C2011-01-01+type%3Auser&type=Users) matches personal accounts named "mike" that were created before 2011.
| `type:org` | [**data in:email type:org**](https://github.com/search?q=data+in%3Aemail+type%3Aorg&type=Users) matches organizations  with the word "data" in their email.

## Search by account name, full name, or public email

You can filter your search to the personal user or organization account name with `user` or `org` qualifiers.

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search to the username (`login`), full name, public email, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the username and email address are searched. For privacy reasons, you cannot search by email domain name.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `user:name` | [**user:octocat**](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aoctocat&type=Users) matches the user with the username "octocat".
| `org:name` | [**org:electron type:users**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aelectron+type%3Ausers&type=Users) matches the Electron organization's account name.
| `in:login` | [**kenya in:login**](https://github.com/search?q=kenya+in%3Alogin&type=Users) matches users with the word "kenya" in their username.
| `in:name` | [**bolton in:name**](https://github.com/search?q=bolton+in%3Afullname&type=Users) matches users whose real name contains the word "bolton."
| `fullname:firstname lastname` | [**fullname:nat friedman**](https://github.com/search?q=fullname%3Anat+friedman&type=Users) matches a user with the full name "Nat Friedman." Note: This search qualifier is sensitive to spacing.
| `in:email` | [**data in:email**](https://github.com/search?q=data+in%3Aemail&type=Users&utf8=%E2%9C%93) matches users with the word "data" in their email.

## Search by number of repositories a user owns

You can filter users based on the number of repositories they own, using the `repos` qualifier and [greater than, less than, and range qualifiers](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax).

## Search by when a personal account was created

You can filter users based on when they joined {% data variables.product.product_name %} with the `created` qualifier. This takes a date as its parameter. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

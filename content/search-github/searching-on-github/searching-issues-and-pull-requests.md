You can search for issues and pull requests globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or search for issues and pull requests within a particular organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github)."

{% tip %}

**Tips:**{% ifversion ghes %}
* This article contains example searches on the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.com website, but you can use the same search filters on {% data variables.location.product_location %}.{% endif %}
{% ifversion issues-advanced-search %}* If your organization has opted-in to the {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} of advanced issue search, you can use boolean and nested queries on your repository's issues page. See "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#building-advanced-filters-for-issues)."{% endif %}
* For a list of search syntaxes that you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)".
* Use quotations around multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label "In progress," you'd search for `label:"in progress"`. Search is not case sensitive.
* Use a minus (hyphen) symbol to exclude results that match a qualifier. For example, to ignore issues created by the "octocat" user, you'd use `-author:octocat` in your search. Note that this does not work for [missing metadata qualifiers](#search-by-missing-metadata).

  {% endtip %}

## Search only issues or pull requests

By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} search will return both issues and pull requests. However, you can restrict search results to just issues or pull requests using the `type` or `is` qualifier.

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `type:pr` | [**cat type:pr**](https://github.com/search?q=cat+type%3Apr&type=Issues) matches pull requests with the word "cat."
| `type:issue` | [**github commenter:defunkt type:issue**](https://github.com/search?q=github+commenter%3Adefunkt+type%3Aissue&type=Issues) matches issues that contain the word "github," and have a comment by @defunkt.
| `is:pr` | [**event is:pr**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=event+is%3Apr&type=) matches pull requests with the word "event."
| `is:issue` | [**is:issue label:bug is:closed**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+is%3Aclosed&type=) matches closed issues with the label "bug."

## Search by the title, body, or comments

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search to the title, body, comments, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, the title, body, and comments are all searched.

| Qualifier     | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `in:title` | [**warning in:title**](https://github.com/search?q=warning+in%3Atitle&type=Issues) matches issues with "warning" in their title.
| `in:body` | [**error in:title,body**](https://github.com/search?q=error+in%3Atitle%2Cbody&type=Issues) matches issues with "error" in their title or body.
| `in:comments` | [**shipit in:comments**](https://github.com/search?q=shipit+in%3Acomment&type=Issues) matches issues mentioning "shipit" in their comments.

## Search within a user's or organization's repositories

To search issues and pull requests in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the  `user` or `org` qualifier. To search issues and pull requests in a specific repository, you can use the `repo` qualifier.

{% data reusables.pull_requests.large-search-workaround %}

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>user:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**user:defunkt ubuntu**](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Adefunkt+ubuntu&type=Issues) matches issues with the word "ubuntu" from repositories owned by @defunkt.
| <code>org:<em>ORGNAME</em></code> | [**org:github**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agithub&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93) matches issues in repositories owned by the GitHub organization.
| <code>repo:<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em></code> | [**repo:mozilla/shumway created:<2012-03-01**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Amozilla%2Fshumway+created%3A%3C2012-03-01&type=Issues) matches issues from @mozilla's shumway project that were created before March 2012.

## Search by open or closed state

You can filter issues and pull requests based on whether they're open or closed using the `state` or `is` qualifier.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `state:open` | [**libraries state:open mentions:vmg**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=libraries+state%3Aopen+mentions%3Avmg&type=Issues) matches open issues that mention @vmg with the word "libraries."

| `is:open` | [**performance is:open is:issue**](https://github.com/search?q=performance+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue&type=Issues) matches open issues with the word "performance."
| `is:closed` | [**android is:closed**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=android+is%3Aclosed&type=) matches closed issues and pull requests with the word "android."

{% ifversion merge-queue  %}

## Search for pull requests in the merge queue

You can also use the `is` qualifier to find pull requests that are queued to merge.

| Qualifier | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `is:queued` | [**is:queued**](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aqueued&type=pullrequests) matches pull requests that are currently queued to merge.

{% endif %}

## Search by the reason an issue was closed

You can filter issues based on the reason given when the issue was closed, using the `reason` qualifier.

| Qualifier        | Example

## Filter by repository visibility

You can filter by the visibility of the repository containing the issues and pull requests using the `is` qualifier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility)."

| Qualifier  | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `is:public` | [**is:public**](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apublic&type=Issues) matches issues and pull requests in public repositories. |

| {% endif %} |
| `is:private` | [**is:private cupcake**](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aprivate+cupcake&type=Issues) matches issues and pull requests that contain the word "cupcake" in private repositories you can access.

## Search by author

The `author` qualifier finds issues and pull requests created by a certain user or integration account.

| `in:body` <code>author:<em>USERNAME</em></code>  | [**bootstrap in:body author:mdo**](https://github.com/search?q=bootstrap+in%3Abody+author%3Amdo&type=Issues) matches issues written by @mdo that contain the word "bootstrap" in the body.
| <code>author:app/<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**author:app/robot**](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Aapp%2Frobot&type=Issues) matches issues created by the integration account named "robot."
| <code>-</code><code>author:app/<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**-author:app/robot**](https://github.com/search?q=-author%3Aapp%2Frobot&type=Issues) matches issues created by any user other than the integration account named "robot." The minus sign, or dash character (<code>-</code>) before the qualifier signifies a logical NOT for the qualifier in the search query.

## Search by assignee

The `assignee` qualifier finds issues and pull requests that are assigned to a certain user. You can search for issues and pull requests that have _any_ assignee by using the wildcard character `*`, but only within a single repository. You can also search for [issues and pull requests that have no assignee](#search-by-missing-metadata).

| Qualifier     | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>assignee:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**assignee:vmg repo:libgit2/libgit2**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=assignee%3Avmg+repo%3Alibgit2%2Flibgit2&type=Issues) matches issues and pull requests in libgit2's project libgit2 that are assigned to @vmg.

## Search by mention

The `mentions` qualifier finds issues that mention a certain user. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams)."

## Search by team mention

For organizations and teams you belong to, you can use the `team` qualifier to find issues or pull requests that @mention a certain team within that organization. Replace these sample names with your organization and team name to perform a search.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>team:<em>ORGNAME/TEAMNAME</em></code> | **`team:jekyll/owners`** matches issues where the `@jekyll/owners` team is mentioned.
| <code>team:<em>ORGNAME/TEAMNAME</em></code> `is:open is:pr` | **team:myorg/ops is:open is:pr** matches open pull requests where the `@myorg/ops` team is mentioned.

## Search by commenter

The `commenter` qualifier finds issues that contain a comment from a certain user.

## Search by a user that's involved in an issue or pull request

You can use the `involves` qualifier to find issues that in some way involve a certain user. The `involves` qualifier is a logical OR between the `author`, `assignee`, `mentions`, and `commenter` qualifiers for a single user. In other words, this qualifier finds issues and pull requests that were either created by a certain user, assigned to that user, mention that user, or were commented on by that user.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>involves:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | **[involves:defunkt involves:jlord](https://github.com/search?q=involves%3Adefunkt+involves%3Ajlord&type=Issues)** matches issues either @defunkt or @jlord are involved in.
| `in:body` <code>involves:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**NOT bootstrap in:body involves:mdo**](https://github.com/search?q=NOT+bootstrap+in%3Abody+involves%3Amdo&type=Issues) matches issues @mdo is involved in that do not contain the word "bootstrap" in the body.

## Search for my issues and pull requests

You can search for issues and pull requests you have created or have interacted with by following the desired qualifier with `@me`. Any qualifier that works with a username allows you to limit your search to issues and pull requests you created, are assigned, mentioned on, or are requested as a reviewer of.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>author:<em>@me</em></code> | **[author:@me](https://github.com/search?q=author%3A%40me)** matches issues and pull requests you have authored.

## Search for linked issues and pull requests

You can narrow your results to only include issues that are linked to a pull request by a closing reference, or pull requests that are linked to an issue that the pull request may close.

| Qualifier | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `linked:pr` | [**repo:desktop/desktop is:open linked:pr**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adesktop%2Fdesktop+is%3Aopen+linked%3Apr) matches open issues in the `desktop/desktop` repository that are linked to a pull request by a closing reference. |
| `linked:issue` | [**repo:desktop/desktop is:closed linked:issue**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adesktop%2Fdesktop+is%3Aclosed+linked%3Aissue) matches closed pull requests in the `desktop/desktop` repository that were linked to an issue that the pull request may have closed. |
| `-linked:pr` | [**repo:desktop/desktop is:open -linked:pr**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adesktop%2Fdesktop+is%3Aopen+-linked%3Apr) matches open issues in the `desktop/desktop` repository that are not linked to a pull request by a closing reference. |
| `-linked:issue` | [**repo:desktop/desktop is:open -linked:issue**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adesktop%2Fdesktop+is%3Aopen+-linked%3Aissue) matches open pull requests in the `desktop/desktop` repository that are not linked to an issue that the pull request may close. |

## Search by label

You can narrow your results by labels, using the `label` qualifier. Since issues can have multiple labels, you can list a separate qualifier for each issue.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>label:<em>LABEL</em></code> | [**label:"help wanted" language:ruby**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22+language%3Aruby&type=Issues) matches issues with the label "help wanted" that are in Ruby repositories.
| `in:body` <code>-label:<em>LABEL</em></code> <code>label:<em>LABEL</em></code> | [**broken in:body -label:bug label:priority**](https://github.com/search?q=broken+in%3Abody+-label%3Abug+label%3Apriority&type=Issues) matches issues with the word "broken" in the body, that lack the label "bug", but _do_ have the label "priority."
| <code>label:<em>LABEL</em></code> <code>label:<em>LABEL</em></code> | [**label:bug label:resolved**](https://github.com/search?l=&q=label%3Abug+label%3Aresolved&type=Issues) matches issues with the labels "bug" and "resolved."
| <code>label:<em>LABEL,LABEL</em></code> | [**label:bug,resolved**](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Abug%2Cresolved&type=Issues) matches issues with the label "bug" or the label "resolved."

## Search by milestone

The `milestone` qualifier finds issues or pull requests that are a part of a [milestone](/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) within a repository.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>milestone:<em>MILESTONE</em></code> | [**milestone:"overhaul"**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A%22overhaul%22&type=Issues) matches issues that are in a milestone named "overhaul."
| <code>milestone:<em>MILESTONE</em></code> | [**milestone:"bug fix"**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A%22bug+fix%22&type=Issues) matches issues that are in a milestone named "bug fix."

## Search by project

You can use the `project` qualifier to find issues that are associated with a specific project. You must search projects by the project number. You can find the project number at the end of a project's URL.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>project:<em>PROJECT_NUMBER</em></code> | **project:github/57** matches issues owned by GitHub that are associated with the organization's project 57.
| <code>project:<em>REPOSITORY/PROJECT_NUMBER</em></code> | **project:github-linguist/linguist/1** matches issues that are associated with project 1 in @github's linguist repository.

## Search by commit status

You can filter pull requests based on the status of the commits. This is especially useful if you are using [the Status API](/rest/commits#commit-statuses) or a CI service.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `status:pending` | [**language:go status:pending**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago+status%3Apending) matches pull requests opened into Go repositories where the status is pending.
| `status:success` | [**is:open status:success finally in:body**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+status%3Asuccess+finally+in%3Abody&type=Issues) matches open pull requests with the word "finally" in the body with a successful status.
| `status:failure` | [**created:2015-05-01..2015-05-30 status:failure**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=created%3A2015-05-01..2015-05-30+status%3Afailure&type=Issues) matches pull requests opened on May 2015 with a failed status.

## Search by commit SHA

If you know the specific SHA hash of a commit, you can use it to search for pull requests that contain that SHA. The SHA syntax must be at least seven characters.

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code><em>SHA</em></code> | [**e1109ab**](https://github.com/search?q=e1109ab&type=Issues) matches pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with `e1109ab`.
| <code><em>SHA</em></code> `is:merged`  | [**0eff326d6213c is:merged**](https://github.com/search?q=0eff326d+is%3Amerged&type=Issues) matches merged pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with `0eff326d6213c`.

## Search by branch name

You can filter pull requests based on the branch they came from (the "head" branch) or the branch they are merging into (the "base" branch).

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>head:<em>HEAD_BRANCH</em></code> | [**head:change is:closed is:unmerged**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=head%3Achange+is%3Aclosed+is%3Aunmerged) matches pull requests opened from branch names beginning with the word "change" that are closed.
| <code>base:<em>BASE_BRANCH</em></code> | [**base:gh-pages**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=base%3Agh-pages) matches pull requests that are being merged into the `gh-pages` branch.

## Search by number of interactions

You can filter issues and pull requests by the number of interactions with the `interactions` qualifier along with [greater than, less than, and range qualifiers](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax). The interactions count is the number of reactions and comments on an issue or pull request.

Requested reviewers are no longer listed in the search results after they review a pull request.

## Search by when an issue or pull request was created or last updated

You can filter issues based on times of creation, or when they were last updated. For issue creation, you can use the `created` qualifier; to find out when an issue was last updated, you'll want to use the `updated` qualifier.

Both take a date as a parameter. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>created:<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em></code> | [**language:c# created:<2011-01-01 state:open**](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ac%23+created%3A%3C2011-01-01+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) matches open issues that were created before 2011 in repositories written in C#.

## Search by when an issue or pull request was closed

You can filter issues and pull requests based on when they were closed, using the `closed` qualifier.

This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

| Qualifier        | Example

## Search by when a pull request was merged

You can filter pull requests based on when they were merged, using the `merged` qualifier.

This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %}

| Qualifier        | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| <code>language:<em>LANGUAGE</em></code> <code>merged:<<em>YYYY-MM-DD</em></code> | [**`language:javascript merged:<2011-01-01`**](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ajavascript+merged%3A%3C2011-01-01+&type=Issues) matches pull requests in JavaScript repositories that were merged before 2011.
| `in:title` <code>language:<em>LANGUAGE</em></code> <code>merged:><em>YYYY-MM-DD</em></code> | [**fast in:title language:ruby merged:>=2014-05-01**](https://github.com/search?q=fast+in%3Atitle+language%3Aruby+merged%3A%3E%3D2014-05-01+&type=Issues) matches pull requests in Ruby with the word "fast" in the title that were merged after May 2014.

## Search based on whether a pull request is merged or unmerged

You can filter pull requests based on whether they're merged or unmerged using the `is` qualifier.

| `is:unmerged` | [**error is:unmerged**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=error+is%3Aunmerged&type=) matches pull requests with the word "error" that are either open or were closed without being merged.

## Search based on whether a repository is archived

The `archived` qualifier filters your results based on whether an issue or pull request is in an archived repository.

| Qualifier     | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `archived:true` | [**archived:true GNOME**](https://github.com/search?q=archived%3Atrue+GNOME&type=) matches issues and pull requests that contain the word "GNOME" in archived repositories you have access to.
| `archived:false` | [**archived:false GNOME**](https://github.com/search?q=archived%3Afalse+GNOME&type=) matches issues and pull requests that contain the word "GNOME" in unarchived repositories you have access to.

## Search based on whether a conversation is locked

You can search for an issue or pull request that has a locked conversation using the `is` qualifier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

| Qualifier        | Example

## Search by missing metadata

You can narrow your search to issues and pull requests that are missing certain metadata, using the `no` qualifier. These qualifiers cannot be combined with the minus (hyphen) symbol to exclude items that are missing metadata. That metadata includes:

* Labels
* Milestones
* Assignees
* Projects

| ------------- | -------------
| `no:label` | [**priority no:label**](https://github.com/search?q=priority+no%3Alabel&type=Issues) matches issues and pull requests with the word "priority" that also don't have any labels.

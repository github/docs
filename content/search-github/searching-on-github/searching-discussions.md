## About searching for discussions

You can search for discussions globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or search for discussions within a particular organization or repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github)."

{% data reusables.search.syntax_tips %}

## Search by the title, body, or comments

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search for discussions to the title, body, or comments. You can also combine qualifiers to search a combination of title, body, or comments. When you omit the `in` qualifier, {% data variables.product.product_name %} searches the title, body, and comments.

| Qualifier | Example |
| :- | :- |
| `in:title` | [**welcome in:title**](https://github.com/search?q=welcome+in%3Atitle&type=Discussions) matches discussions with "welcome" in the title. |
| `in:body` | [**onboard in:title,body**](https://github.com/search?q=onboard+in%3Atitle%2Cbody&type=Discussions) matches discussions with "onboard" in the title or body. |
| `in:comments` | [**thanks in:comments**](https://github.com/search?q=thanks+in%3Acomment&type=Discussions) matches discussions with "thanks" in the comments for the discussion. |

## Search within a user's or organization's repositories

To search discussions in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the  `user` or `org` qualifier. To search discussions in a specific repository, you can use the `repo` qualifier.

| <code>user:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**user:octocat feedback**](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aoctocat+feedback&type=Discussions) matches discussions with the word "feedback" from repositories owned by @octocat. |
| <code>org:<em>ORGNAME</em></code> | [**org:github**](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agithub&type=Discussions&utf8=%E2%9C%93) matches discussions in repositories owned by the GitHub organization. |
| <code>repo:<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em></code> | [**repo:nodejs/node created:<2021-01-01**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Anodejs%2Fnode+created%3A%3C2020-01-01&type=Discussions) matches discussions from @nodejs' Node.js runtime project that were created before January 2021. |

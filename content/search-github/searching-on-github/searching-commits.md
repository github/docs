You can search for commits globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_name %}, or search for commits within a particular repository or organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github)."

When you search for commits, only the [default branch](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) of a repository is searched.

## Search within commit messages

You can find commits that contain particular words in the message. For example, [**fix typo**](https://github.com/search?q=fix+typo&type=Commits) matches commits containing the words "fix" and "typo."

## Search by author or committer

You can find commits by a particular user with the `author` or `committer` qualifiers.

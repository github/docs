---
You can search for repositories globally across all of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, or search for repositories within a particular organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github)."

To include forks in the search results, you will need to add `fork:true` or `fork:only` to your query. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-in-forks)."

{% data reusables.search.syntax_tips %}

## Search by repository name, description, or contents of the README file

With the `in` qualifier you can restrict your search to the repository name, repository description, repository topics, contents of the README file, or any combination of these. When you omit this qualifier, only the repository name, description, and topics are searched.

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `in:name` | [**jquery in:name**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Aname&type=Repositories) matches repositories with "jquery" in the repository name.
| `in:description`  | [**jquery in:name,description**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Aname%2Cdescription&type=Repositories) matches repositories with "jquery" in the repository name or description.
| `in:topics`  | [**jquery in:topics**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Atopics&type=Repositories) matches repositories labeled with "jquery" as a topic.
| `in:readme` | [**jquery in:readme**](https://github.com/search?q=jquery+in%3Areadme&type=Repositories) matches repositories mentioning "jquery" in the repository's README file.
| `repo:owner/name` | [**repo:octocat/hello-world**](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aoctocat%2Fhello-world) matches a specific repository name.

## Search based on the contents of a repository

You can find a repository by searching for content in the repository's README file using the `in:readme` qualifier. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)."

Besides using `in:readme`, it's not possible to find repositories by searching for specific content within the repository. To search for a specific file or content within a repository, you can use the file finder or code-specific search qualifiers. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/finding-files-on-github)" and "[AUTOTITLE]{% ifversion code-search-upgrade %}(/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax){% else %}(/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code){% endif %}."

| Qualifier  | Example
| ------------- | -------------
| `in:readme` | [**octocat in:readme**](https://github.com/search?q=octocat+in%3Areadme&type=Repositories) matches repositories mentioning "octocat" in the repository's README file.

## Search within a user's or organization's repositories

To search in all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the  `user` or `org` qualifier.

## Search by repository size

The `size` qualifier finds repositories that match a certain size (in kilobytes), using greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)."

## Search by when a repository was created or last updated

You can filter repositories based on time of creation or time of last update.

## Search gists

You can search for gists globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

| Qualifier | Example |
| :- | :- |
| <code>><em>n</em></code> | [**cat stars:>100**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=cat+stars%3A%3E100) finds gists with the word "cat" that have more than 100 stars.|
| <code>user:<em>USERNAME</em></code> | [**user:octocat**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=user%3Aoctocat) gets all gists created by @octocat. |
| `anon:true` | [**cat anon:true**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=cat+anon%3Atrue&ref=searchresults) includes anonymous gists in your search for cat-related gists. |
| `NOT` | [**NOT cat**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=NOT+cat&ref=searchresults) excludes all results containing cat. |
| `fork:only` | [**cat fork:only**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=cat+fork%3Aonly&ref=searchresults) matches all fork repositories containing the word "cat." |

## Filter content

Gist search looks through the file contents by default. You can also filter the results based on the content.

| Qualifier | Example |
| :- | :- |
| <code>filename:<em>FILENAME</em></code> | [**filename:.bashrc**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=filename%3A.bashrc&ref=searchresults) finds all gists with a ".bashrc" file. |
| <code>language:<em>LANGUAGE</em></code> | [**cat language:html**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=cat+language%3Ahtml&ref=searchresults) finds all gists with the word "cat" with a HTML file. |
| <code>extension:<em>EXTENSION</em></code> | [**join extension:coffee**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=join+extension%3Acoffee&ref=searchresults) finds all instances of "join" in gists with a coffee extension. |
| <code>size:><em>n</em></code> | [**system size:>1000**](https://gist.github.com/search?q=system+size%3A%3E1000&ref=searchresults) finds all instances of "system" in gists containing a file larger than 1 MB. |

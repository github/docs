## Narrowing your search with search qualifiers

If you want to explore repositories about a certain topic, find projects to contribute to, or learn which topics are most popular on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can search topics with the search qualifiers `is:featured`, `is:curated`, `repositories:n` and `created:YYYY-MM-DD`.

The `is:featured` search qualifier will narrow search results to the topics with the most repositories on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. These topics are also featured at https://github.com/topics/.

The `is:curated` search qualifier will narrow search results to topics that community members have added extra information to. For more information, see the [explore repository](https://github.com/github/explore).

You can filter topics based when they were created using the date parameter and `created:` or based on how many repositories are associated with this topic using `repositories:n`. Both of these qualifiers can use the [greater than and less than range qualifiers](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax).

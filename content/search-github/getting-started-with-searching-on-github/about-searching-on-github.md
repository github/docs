In addition to the search bar, you can search {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the {% data variables.search.search_page_url %} or {% data variables.search.advanced_url %}. {% ifversion command-palette %}Alternatively, you can use the interactive search in the {% data variables.product.prodname_command_palette %} to search your current location in the UI, a specific user, repository or organization, and globally across all of {% data variables.product.product_name %}, without leaving the keyboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette)."{% endif %}

The {% data variables.search.advanced_url %} provides a visual interface for constructing search queries. You can filter your searches by a variety of factors, such as the number of stars or number of forks a repository has. As you fill in the advanced search fields, your query will automatically be constructed in the top search bar.

![Advanced Search page. Top search bar holds "kittens user:octocat" query. Under "Advanced options", "From these owners" text box holds term "octocat".](/assets/images/help/search/advanced-search.png)

## Searching repositories on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} from your private enterprise environment

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

If you use both {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, and an enterprise owner has enabled {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_unified_search %}, you can search across both environments at the same time from {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github#searching-repositories-on-githubcom-from-your-private-enterprise-environment)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation.

{% else %}

If you use both {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} and {% data variables.product.product_name %}, and an enterprise owner has enabled {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_unified_search %}, you can search across both environments at the same time from {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information about how enterprise owners can enable {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_unified_search %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/enabling-unified-search-for-your-enterprise)."

Your enterprise owner on {% data variables.product.product_name %} can separately enable {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_unified_search %} for all public repositories on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} and for private repositories owned by the organization or enterprise on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} that is connected to {% data variables.product.product_name %} through {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}.

Before you can use {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_unified_search %} for private repositories, you must connect your personal accounts on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} and {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/enabling-githubcom-repository-search-from-your-private-enterprise-environment)."

When you search from {% data variables.product.product_name %}, only private repositories that you have access to and that are owned by the connected organization or enterprise account will be included in search results. Neither you nor anyone else will be able to search private repositories owned by your personal account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} from {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

To limit your search to one environment, you can use a filter option on the {% data variables.search.advanced_url %} or you can use the `environment:` search prefix. To only search for content on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, use the search syntax `environment:local`. To only search for content on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, use `environment:github`.

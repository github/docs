Use the **Sort** dropdown menu to sort results by relevance, number of stars, number of forks, and how recently the items were updated.

To sort by interactions, reactions, author date, committer date, or how recently the items were updated, you can add a `sort` qualifier to your search query.

| `sort:interactions-asc` | [**org:github sort:interactions-asc**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Agithub+sort%3Ainteractions-asc&type=Issues) matches issues in repositories owned by {% data variables.product.product_name %}, sorted by the lowest combined number of reactions and comments.

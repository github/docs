## Organization alerts notification options

If you're an organization owner, you'll receive email notifications by default when organization members add new deploy keys to repositories within the organization. You can unsubscribe from these notifications. On the notification settings page, under "Organization alerts", deselect **Email**.

## Choosing where your organizationâ€™s email notifications are sent

If you belong to an organization, you can choose the email account you want notifications for organization activity sent to. For example, if you belong to an organization for work, you may want your notifications sent to your work email address, rather than your personal address.

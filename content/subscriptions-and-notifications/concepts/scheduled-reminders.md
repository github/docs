Scheduled reminders are used to make sure that users focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to you in Slack with open pull requests needing your review at a specified time. For example, you can setup scheduled reminders to send you a message in Slack every morning at 10 AM with pull requests needing to be reviewed by you or one of your teams.

For certain events, you can also enable real-time alerts for scheduled reminders. Real-time alerts get sent to your Slack channel as soon as an important event, such as when you are assigned a review, is triggered by another user.

You can set scheduled reminders for personal or team-level review requests for pull requests in organizations you are a member of. Before you can create a scheduled reminder for yourself, an organization owner must authorize your Slack workspace. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-organization).

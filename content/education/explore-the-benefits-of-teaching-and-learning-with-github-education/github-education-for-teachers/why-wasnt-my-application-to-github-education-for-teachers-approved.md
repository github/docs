## Unclear proof of affiliation documents

If the image you uploaded doesn't clearly identify your current employment with a school or university, you must reapply and upload another image of your faculty ID or employment verification letter with clear information.

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

## Using an academic email with an unverified domain

If your academic email address has an unverified domain, we may require further proof of your academic status. {% data reusables.education.upload-different-image %}

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

## Using an academic email from a school with lax email policies

If alumni and retired faculty of your school have lifetime access to school-issued email addresses, we may require further proof of your academic status. {% data reusables.education.upload-different-image %}

{% data reusables.education.pdf-support %}

If you have other questions or concerns about the school domain, please ask your school IT staff to contact us.

GitHub Education Benefits include access to the Student Developer Pack (the Pack), a selection of 80+ resources for students. When you are accepted into the GitHub Education Program, you are given access to these additional products and features provided by both GitHub and third-party organizations. Due to the varied nature of the Pack, your Agreement with us (the “Agreement”) includes the specific terms for that GitHub product or feature combined with your main agreement—the [GitHub Terms of Service](/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and the [GitHub Customer Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms). Below, we’ve listed the specific policies and conditions for GitHub Education and the Pack, along with the corresponding terms that apply to your use of them.

By being a member of GitHub Education and accessing the Student Developer Pack, you may also be entitled to access products from other companies represented in the Pack. Each of those products may have different terms and conditions from the companies offering those products. These terms may be different from the terms established by GitHub for its products. If you use a third-party company’s products, your agreement for the use of those products is between you and them – and not you and GitHub. GitHub will have no obligation, responsibility, or liability for the use of those products—and you are responsible for complying with any terms associated with those third-party products.

## GitHub Education Terms and Conditions

* All users must be actively verified as a student by the GitHub Education team. You can become verified directly from your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/education/benefits). Note that teachers, researchers, faculty, staff, and other educational users can get free and discounted access to GitHub, but are not eligible for the Pack.
* Student validation lasts for 2 years, after which you will need to revalidate your student status.
* All users must be 13 years of age or older. Certain third-party offers may have additional age restrictions.
* Offers may not be redeemed multiple times. For example, users will not be able to make a new account on a third-party website to reset a time-limited offer or “reset” the time-limited offering by re-verifying their student status.
* Some partners do not allow the “stacking” of promotional offers, so if users have previously redeemed a free trial, access via the Pack may not be available.
* Third-party offers in the Pack are subject to change at the request of the partner offering the benefit. When possible, the GitHub Education team will try to notify users in advance, but service may still be disrupted. For service disruptions please see the Student Developer Pack [Changelog](https://github.com/github-education-resources/Student-Developer-Pack-Current-Partners-FAQ/blob/main/SDP-changelog.md).
* GitHub Education does not control third-party offers or the terms and conditions associated with partner tools or products. Additionally, GitHub Education does not influence how partner terms and conditions are implemented or enforced. Any agreement between students and partners with respect to tools or products are between the student and partner only.

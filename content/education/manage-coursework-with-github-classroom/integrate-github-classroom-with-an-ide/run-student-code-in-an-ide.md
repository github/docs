## About student code and IDEs

If you configure an integrated development environment (IDE) for an assignment, you can run the code within the IDE. You don't need to clone the assignment repository to your computer.

For more information about IDEs, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide)."

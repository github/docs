## About student code and IDEs

If you configure an integrated development environment (IDE) for an assignment, you can run the code within the IDE. You don't need to clone the assignment repository to your computer.

For more information about IDEs, see "[Integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an IDE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide)."

## Running student code in the IDE 

{% data reusables.classroom.sign-into-github-classroom %}
{% data reusables.classroom.click-classroom-in-list %}
{% data reusables.classroom.click-assignment-in-list %}
1. To the right of the submission, click **View IDE**.

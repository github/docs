## About registering an LMS to your classroom

Before you can connect your LMS to a classroom, an administrator for your LMS instance needs to configure your LMS to allow {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} and then register your LMS with {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} to initiate the OAuth handshake. An admin only needs to do this registration process once, then any teacher who uses their LMS instance may sync their LMS courses to classrooms. For more information on connecting an LMS course to a classroom, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/connect-a-learning-management-system-course-to-a-classroom)."

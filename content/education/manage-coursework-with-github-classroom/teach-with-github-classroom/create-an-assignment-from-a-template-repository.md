shortTitle: Template repository

You can use a template repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %} as starter code for an assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. Your template repository can contain boilerplate code, documentation, and other resources for your students. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)."

To use the template repository for your assignment, the template repository must be owned by your organization, or the visibility of the template repository must be public.

When you create your assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} creates a new repository from the template in your organization with the visibility you select (for more information on creating repositories from templates, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)").

Student assignment repositories will be forks of this created repository. You can choose whether all branches are included in student assignment repositories, or just the default branch.

You can reuse an existing assignment, even if it uses a template repository, in any other classroom that you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment)."

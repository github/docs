shortTitle: Template repository

You can use a template repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %} as starter code for an assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. Your template repository can contain boilerplate code, documentation, and other resources for your students. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)."

To use the template repository for your assignment, the template repository must be owned by your organization, or the visibility of the template repository must be public.

You can reuse an existing assignment, even if it uses a template repository, in any other classroom that you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment)."

### Importing the assignment

To import the Git & {% data variables.product.product_name %} starter assignment into your organization, click **Import the assignment**.

### Naming the assignment

For an individual assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} names repositories by the repository prefix and the student's {% data variables.product.product_name %} username. By default, the repository prefix is the assignment title. For example, if you name an assignment "assignment-1" and the student's username on {% data variables.product.product_name %} is @octocat, the name of the assignment repository for @octocat will be `assignment-1-octocat`.

{% data reusables.classroom.assignments-guide-make-cutoff-date %}

### Choosing a visibility for assignment repositories

The repositories for an assignment can be public or private. If you use private repositories, only the student can see the feedback you provide. Under "Repository visibility," select a visibility.

When you're done, click **Continue**. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will create the assignment and bring you to the assignment page.

## Inviting students to an assignment

{% data reusables.classroom.assignments-guide-invite-students-to-assignment %}

You can see whether a student has joined the classroom and accepted or submitted an assignment in the **All students** tab for the assignment. {% data reusables.classroom.assignments-to-prevent-submission %}

The Git & {% data variables.product.company_short %} starter assignment is only available for individual students, not for groups. Once you create the assignment, students can start work on the assignment.

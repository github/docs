## About assignment deadlines

Your teacher can set an assignment deadline for assignments on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. If your teacher makes a deadline a hard cutoff, unless you or your group have received an extension, you will lose write access to your assignment repository after the deadline passes. You can easily monitor the deadline for an assignment through the README in your assignment repository.

## Viewing an assignment's deadline

1. Navigate to your assignment repository.
1. On the main page of your repository, scroll down until you see the repository's README, then click {% octicon "calendar" aria-hidden="true" %} **Review the assignment due date**. Your assignment deadline is visible below the link to your assignment repository. The deadline shown updates automatically any time your teacher alters the assignment deadline.

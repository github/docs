httputil: Fix quadratic performance of cookie parsing
Maliciously-crafted cookies can cause Tornado to
spend an unreasonable amount of CPU time and block
the event loop.

This change replaces the quadratic algorithm with
a more efficient one. The implementation is copied
from the Python 3.13 standard library (the
previous one was from Python 3.5).

Fixes CVE-2024-52804
See CVE-2024-7592 for a similar vulnerability in cpython.

Thanks to github.com/kexinoh for the report.

Update
We have an updated ETA on correcting all Copilot metrics API data: 20 hours. We won't post more updates here unless the ETA changes.
Posted 42 minutes ago. Apr 16, 2025 - 05:11 UTC
Update
We are working on correcting the Copilot metrics API source data from March 19th to April 14th. Currently, the API returns about 10% lower usage numbers than the reality. We don't have an ETA for the resolution at the moment.
Posted 4 hours ago. Apr 16, 2025 - 01:46 UTC
Update
The Copilot metrics API (https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28) now returns accurate data for April 15th. We're working on correcting the past 27 days, as we are under-reporting certain metrics from this time.
Posted 5 hours ago. Apr 16, 2025 - 00:41 UTC
Update
We'll have accurate data for April 15th in the next 60 minutes. We're still working on correcting the data for the additional 27 days before April 15th. The complete correction is estimated to take up to 7 days, but we're working to speed this up.

https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28 is the specific impacted API.
Posted 6 hours ago. Apr 15, 2025 - 23:33 UTC
Update
As we've made further progress on correcting the inconsistencies, we estimate it will take approximately a week for a full recovery. We are investigating options for speeding up the recovery, and we appreciate your patience as we work through this incident.
Posted 8 hours ago. Apr 15, 2025 - 21:45 UTC
Update
We are working on correcting the inconsistencies now, our next update we will provide an estimated time when the issue will be fully resolved.
Posted 11 hours ago. Apr 15, 2025 - 19:02 UTC
Update
We are currently experiencing degraded performance with our Copilot metrics API, which is temporarily causing partial inconsistencies in the data returned. Our engineering teams are actively working to restore full functionality. We understand the importance of timely updates and are prioritizing a resolution to ensure all systems are operating normally as quickly as possible.

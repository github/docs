## Best practices for organizations in an enterprise

There are multiple options for structuring the organizations within your enterprise. Each approach has pros and cons, and the best structure for your enterprise depends on the characteristics and needs of your business, including size and security constraints. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/best-practices-for-structuring-organizations-in-your-enterprise).

## Adding organizations to your enterprise

There are three ways to add organizations to your enterprise.

* **Create** a new organization in your enterprise.
* **Invite** an existing organization to join your enterprise.
* **Transfer** an existing organization between enterprise accounts.

Adding existing organizations to your enterprise is not possible if you use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}. Existing organizations from an enterprise with managed users cannot be added to a different enterprise, and organizations cannot be transferred from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to {% data variables.enterprise.data_residency_site %}.

To learn how to create a new organization, invite an existing organization, or transfer an existing organization, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise).

## Managing your role in an organization

You can choose to join an organization owned by your enterprise as a member or as an organization owner, change your role within the organization, or leave the organization. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise).

## Removing an organization from your enterprise

You can remove an organization that is owned by your enterprise account, so the organization stands alone. To learn more about what happens when an organization is removed, and how to remove an organization in the web interface, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/removing-organizations-from-your-enterprise).

## Next steps

After setting up an organization and adding members, you can create teams in the organization to manage permissions, notifications, and code ownership for groups of people. See [AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-onboarding/setting-up-organizations-and-teams/creating-teams).

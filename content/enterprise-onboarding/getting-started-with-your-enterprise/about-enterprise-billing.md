## About billing for your enterprise

With {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, your enterprise account is the central point for all billing within your enterprise, including the organizations that your enterprise owns. Users with the **enterprise owner** or **billing manager** role can view and manage billing settings for the enterprise.

To pay {% data variables.product.company_short %}, you will add a payment method to your enterprise account. This can be a credit card, PayPal, or a Microsoft Azure subscription.

If you created your enterprise account with help from {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s Sales team, you may have agreed to pay by invoice. Each invoice includes a single charge for all of your paid {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} services and any {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances.

As a new enterprise, you will be on {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s new billing platform, which allows you to estimate spending, create cost centers to track expenses across business units, and pay flexibly for the licenses you need.

## What is included in my bill?

Each month, you will be billed for:

* The number of {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} licenses you use, determined by the number of unique users in your enterprise
* Any usage of features like {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}, beyond the allowances included in your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} plan
* Any extra features you purchase, such as {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} licenses

For prices and monthly allowances, see {% data variables.product.pricing_link %}.

To set up a trial, you must be signed in to a personal account.

<a href="https://github.com/account/enterprises/new?ref_product=ghec&ref_type=trial&ref_style=button&ref_plan=enterprise" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary mt-3 mr-3 no-underline"><span>Try {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}</span> {% octicon "link-external" height:16 aria-label="link-external" %}</a>

## What is included in the trial?

The trial lasts for **{% data reusables.enterprise.ghec-trial-length %} days** and includes the following features.

* Access to **most** {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} features.
* {% data variables.copilot.copilot_for_business %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_cs_and_sp %}
* An **enterprise account**, which allows you to manage multiple organizations.
* Up to **50 licenses** to grant access to users.

## Features not included in the trial

* {% data variables.product.prodname_github_codespaces %}
* {% data variables.copilot.copilot_enterprise %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}
* Paid {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} apps

* {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %}
* For {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, increased minutes, job concurrency, and {% data variables.actions.hosted_runners %}

If you invite an existing organization into your trial enterprise, **all of these features will be disabled**. If you remove the organization from the enterprise, the features will be re-enabled.

## Do I need to provide a payment method?

You do not need to provide a payment method to start a trial. If you want to use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_business_short %} during the trial, you need to provide a credit card. You **won't** be charged for using {% data variables.copilot.copilot_business_short %} during the trial.

## During the trial

After you set up your trial, you can explore {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} by following the suggested tasks on the "Getting started" tab of your enterprise account.

You can create up to **three new organizations** in the trial enterprise, or transfer any number of existing organizations.

* You cannot transfer organizations that have free or paid {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} apps. Free apps are supported for new organizations in the trial.
* Billing for transferred organizations is paused during the trial and any coupons are removed. To reapply a coupon, contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support_page %}.
* Organizations created during the trial cannot be removed from the enterprise account until you purchase {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}.

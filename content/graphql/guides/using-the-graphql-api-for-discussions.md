intro: 'Learn how to use the {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} GraphQL API.'
versions:
  feature: discussions
shortTitle: Use GraphQL for Discussions
---

The {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} GraphQL API allows you to get, create, edit, and delete discussion posts. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)."

This API is available for authenticated users, {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}, and GitHub Apps. Access tokens require the `repo` scope for private repositories and the `public_repo` scope for public repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)."

## Fields

### Repository.discussions

List the discussions within a repository. If `categoryId` is specified, only results within that category will be returned. {% ifversion answered-fields-for-discussions %}If `answered` is not specified, both answered and unanswered discussions will be returned.{% endif %}

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussions(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
  categoryId: ID = null,
  {%- ifversion answered-fields-for-discussions %}
  answered: Boolean = null,
  {%- endif %}
  orderBy: DiscussionOrder = {field: UPDATED_AT, direction: DESC}
) : Discussion
```

#### DiscussionOrder

```graphql
"""
Ways in which discussions can be ordered.
"""
input DiscussionOrder {
  """
  The field by which to order discussions.
  """
  field: DiscussionOrderField!

  """
  The direction in which to order discussions by the specified field.
  """
  direction: OrderDirection!
}
```

```graphql
"""
Properties by which discussion connections can be ordered.
"""
enum DiscussionOrderField {
  """
  Order discussions by creation time.
  """
  CREATED_AT

  """
  Order discussions by most recent modification time.
  """
  UPDATED_AT
}
```

### Repository.discussionCategories

Return the available discussion categories defined within this repository. Each repository may have up to 25 categories. For more information about discussion categories, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions#about-categories-and-formats-for-discussions)."

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussionCategories(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
) : DiscussionCategoryConnection!
```

### Repository.discussion

Get a discussion. Returns `null` if discussion with the specified ID does not exist.

_Signature:_

```graphql
discussion(number: Int!) : Discussion
```

### Repository.pinnedDiscussions

Return discussions pinned to this repository, ordered by pin position.

_Signature:_

```graphql
pinnedDiscussions(
  after: String,
  before: String,
  first: Int,
  last: Int,
) : PinnedDiscussionConnection!
```

## Objects

**Note:** For brevity, connection types are not expanded here. Each connection type mentioned in the schema follows the same pattern as other connections in the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql#connection)."

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "github", name: "some-repo") {
    discussions(first: 10) {
      # type: DiscussionConnection
      totalCount # Int!

      pageInfo {
        # type: PageInfo (from the public schema)
        startCursor
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
        hasPreviousPage
      }

      edges {
        # type: DiscussionEdge
        cursor
        node {
          # type: Discussion
          id

```graphql
"""

## Mutations

These mutations follow the same implementation pattern that other mutations in the GraphQL API. Each mutation accepts a single argument of an `Input` type, named after the mutation, and returns a `Payload` type containing the fields specified.

For example, this is a basic `createDiscussion` mutation that will create a new discussion:

```graphql
mutation {
  # input type: CreateDiscussionInput
  createDiscussion(input: {repositoryId: "1234", categoryId: "5678", body: "The body", title: "The title"}) {

    # response type: CreateDiscussionPayload
    discussion {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### createDiscussion

Input fields:

* `body: String!` The body of the new discussion.
* `title: String!` The title of the new discussion.
* `repositoryId: ID!` The ID of a repository in which to create the discussion.
* `categoryId: ID!` The ID of a `DiscussionCategory` within this repository.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `discussion: Discussion` The discussion that was created.

### updateDiscussion

Input fields:

* `discussionId: ID!` The node ID of the discussion to update.
* `body: String` The new contents of the discussion body.
* `title: String` The new discussion title.
* `categoryId: ID` The node ID of a `DiscussionCategory` within the same repository to change this discussion to.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `discussion: Discussion` The discussion that was modified.

### deleteDiscussion

Input fields:

* `id: ID!` The node ID of the discussion to delete.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `discussion: Discussion` The discussion that was deleted.

### addDiscussionComment

Input fields:

* `body: String!` The contents of the comment.
* `discussionId: ID!` The node ID of the discussion to comment on.
* `replyToId: ID` The node ID of the discussion comment to reply to. If absent, the created comment will be a top-level comment.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `comment: DiscussionComment` The discussion comment that was created.

### updateDiscussionComment

Input fields:

* `body: String!` The new contents of the comment body.
* `commentId: ID!` The node ID of the discussion comment to update.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `comment: DiscussionComment` The discussion comment that was updated.

### deleteDiscussionComment

Input fields:

* `id: ID!` The node ID of the discussion comment to delete.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `comment: DiscussionComment` The discussion comment that was deleted.

### markDiscussionCommentAsAnswer

Input fields:

* `id: ID!` The node ID of the discussion comment to mark as an answer.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `discussion: Discussion` The discussion that includes the chosen comment.

### unmarkDiscussionCommentAsAnswer

Input fields:

* `id: ID!` The node ID of the discussion comment to unmark as an answer.
* `clientMutationId: String` A unique identifier for the client performing the mutation.

Return type fields:

* `clientMutationId: String` The unique identifier provided as an input.
* `discussion: Discussion` The discussion that includes the unmarked comment.

## Search

Discussion may be returned from the top-level `search` field. To search for discussion, specify `type` as `DISCUSSION`. The `SearchResultItemConnection` type has a `discussionCount` field to report the number of returned discussions, and the `Discussion` type is added to the `SearchResultItem` union. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/reference/queries#searchresultitemconnection)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-discussions)."

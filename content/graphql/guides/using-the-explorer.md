## About the GraphQL Explorer

{% ifversion ghec %}

> [!NOTE]
> If your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization uses {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s IP allow list, you won't be able to use the GraphQL Explorer. Instead, we recommend using an alternative GraphQL client IDE.

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

[GraphQL Explorer](/graphql/overview/explorer) is an instance of [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), which is a "graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE."

{% else %}

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), also referred to in this documentation as the GraphQL Explorer, is a "graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE."

{% endif %}

## Query autocompletion

You can use query autocompletion to help you build queries. In the main pane, within the curly brackets of your query, use <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> to display the autocomplete menu.

## Accessing the sidebar docs

All types in a GraphQL schema include a `description` field compiled into documentation. The collapsible **Docs** pane on the right side of the Explorer page allows you to browse documentation about the type system. The docs are automatically updated and will drop fields that are {% data variables.release-phases.closing_down %}.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Docs** sidebar contains the same content that is automatically generated from the schema under [AUTOTITLE](/graphql), though it is formatted differently in places.

## Using the variable pane

Some example calls include [variables](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#working-with-variables) written like this:

```graphql
query($number_of_repos:Int!){
  viewer {
    name
     repositories(last: $number_of_repos) {
       nodes {
         name
       }
     }
   }
}
variables {
   "number_of_repos": 3
}
```

This is the correct format to submit the call using a `POST` request in a `curl` command (as long as you [escape newlines](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#communicating-with-graphql)).

If you want to run the call in the Explorer, enter the `query` segment in the main pane and the variables in the **Query Variables** pane below it. Omit the word `variables` from the Explorer:

```graphql
{
   "number_of_repos": 3
}
```

## Using the Altair GraphQL Client IDE

There are many open source GraphQL client IDEs. For example, you can use Altair to access {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s GraphQL API. To access the GraphQL API with Altair, download and install it from [altair-graphql/altair](https://github.com/altair-graphql/altair). Then, follow the configuration steps below.

### Configuring Altair

1. Get an [access token](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql).
1. Launch Altair.
1. In the left sidebar, below the Altair logo, click **Set Headers**. A new window will open.
1. In the "Header key" field, enter `Authorization`.
1. In the "Header value" field, enter `Bearer TOKEN`, replacing `TOKEN` with your token from the first step.
1. Click **Save** in the bottom right corner of the window to save your authorization header.
1. In the "GraphQL Endpoint" field, enter your GraphQL URL, such as `{% data variables.product.graphql_url %}`.
1. To load the {% data variables.product.company_short %} GraphQL schema, download the [public schema](/graphql/overview/public-schema).
1. In Altair, click on **Docs** on the top right, then the three dots and **Load Schema...**
1. Select the file public schema that you downloaded in an earlier step.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about why `POST` is the method, see [AUTOTITLE](/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#communicating-with-graphql).

You can test your access by querying yourself:

```graphql
query {
  viewer {
    login
  }
}
```

If everything worked correctly, this will display your login. You're all set to start making queries.

## Troubleshooting errors

Because GraphQL is [introspective](/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql#discovering-the-graphql-api), the Explorer supports:

* Intelligent typeaheads aware of the current schema
* Validation error previews as you type

If you enter a query that is not well-formed or does not pass [schema validation](/graphql/guides/introduction-to-graphql#schema), a popup warns you of an error. If you run the query, the error returns in the response pane.

A GraphQL response contains several keys: a `data` hash and an `errors` array.

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Objects must have selections (field 'nodes' returns Repository but has no selections)",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 5,
          "column": 8
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

It's possible you might run into an unexpected error that is not related to the schema. If this happens, the message will include a reference code you can use when reporting the issue:

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Something went wrong while executing your query. This is most likely a GitHub bug. Please include \"7571:3FF6:552G94B:69F45B7:5913BBEQ\" when reporting this issue."
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} recommends checking for errors before using data in a production environment. In GraphQL, failure is not total: portions of GraphQL queries may succeed while others fail.

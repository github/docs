## About schema previews

During the preview period, we may change some features based on developer feedback. If we do make changes, we'll announce them on the [developer blog](https://developer.github.com/changes/) without advance notice.

To access a schema preview, you'll need to provide a custom [media type](/rest/overview/media-types) in the `Accept` header for your requests. Feature documentation for each preview specifies which custom media type to provide.

**Note:** The GraphQL schema members under preview cannot be accessed via the Explorer at this time.

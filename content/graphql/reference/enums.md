## About enums

[Enums](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Enums) represent possible sets of values for a field.

For example, the [`Issue`](/graphql/reference/objects#issue) object has a field called `state`. The state is an enum (specifically, of type [`IssueState`](/graphql/reference/enums#issuestate)) because it may be `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.

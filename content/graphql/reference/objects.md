### About objects

[Objects](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Objects) in GraphQL represent the resources you can access. An object can contain a list of fields, which are specifically typed.

For example, the [`Repository`](/graphql/reference/objects#repository) object has a field called `name`, which is a `String`.

For more information, see "[Introduction to GraphQL](/v4/guides/intro-to-graphql)."

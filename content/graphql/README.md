# GraphQL

The `/content/graphql` directory is where the GitHub GraphQL API docs live!

* The `/content/graphql/guides` and `/content/graphql/overview` directories contain articles that are human-editable.
* The `/content/graphql/reference` directory contains an article for each GraphQL data type used in the GitHub GraphQL API. This content is generated from the data in `src/graphql/data` and should not be edited by a human. **As a result, we cannot accept contributions to GraphQL API reference content in this repository.**

For more information, see the [`/src/graphql/README.md`](/src/graphql/README.md).

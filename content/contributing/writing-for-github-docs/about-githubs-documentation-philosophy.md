## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} documentation philosophy

As the home to the world's largest community of developers, we want to make sure that our documentation is accurate, valuable, inclusive, and easy to use. Our documentation philosophy leads us toward these goals.

- We advocate for our users. This can occur at any point in the documentation process, from planning to writing to publishing. We respond to feedback and proactively work to create the best user experience possible on the {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %} site.
- We write for an international audience, so that our content can be translated and is inclusive of all people.
- We create content that can be accessed by a broad group of users. Our content toolkit includes resources and guidance to reduce barriers for people with disabilities and we prioritize keeping up to date with the latest accessibility standards.
- We create task-based content. We consider what people are trying to accomplish when they use {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, and then we create content that helps them achieve their goals and discover new possibilities.
- We collaborate with teams across {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and the open source community to create high-quality content.

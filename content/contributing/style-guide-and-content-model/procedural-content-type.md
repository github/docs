Procedural content helps people complete a task from start to finish while they are using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

We create procedural articles and procedural sections within larger articles.

## How to write procedural articles

For the procedural content template, see "[AUTOTITLE](/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/templates#procedural-article-template)."

* Follow the style guidelines for procedural steps in "[AUTOTITLE](/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide#procedural-steps)".
* Procedural content can get repetitive––look for opportunities to group related content into a single longer article.
  * Group multiple related procedures into a single article unless there's a reason not to.
  * If disabling a setting or undoing a task requires the same steps and has no special implications, do not write a separate procedure.
  * If disabling a setting or undoing a task requires different steps or has important or special implications, create a longer article to contain both procedures. Use an agnostic title.
* Tell readers the expected outcome of the procedure.
* Include troubleshooting tips as frequently as possible.

## Titles for procedural content

* Procedural articles or procedural sections within articles are task-based and begin with a gerund.
  * Use: "Applying for a student developer pack"
* Use active and specific verbs (brainstorm or use a thesaurus when needed).
* Titles specifically describe the task contained within the article or header, but are general enough to reflect all of the content.
* Article title length: maximum 80 characters, 60 if possible.

Good release notes provide administrators the necessary information to plan system upgrades in environments that require change control, and support end users who want to understand and prepare to use new {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} features and functionality.

Writers source, edit, and publish release notes in collaboration with product DRIs, feature owners, and individual engineers at {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For each individual release, we group release notes by predefined types.

We publish the release notes for [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/release-notes) on {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %}, in the "Enterprise administrators" documentation set.

## Types of releases

{% data variables.product.prodname_docs %} provides release notes for feature releases and patch releases of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-server@latest/admin/overview/about-upgrades-to-new-releases)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} documentation.

## About display of IP addresses in the audit log

By default, {% data variables.product.product_name %} does not display the source IP address for events in your organization's audit log. {% data reusables.audit_log.about-ip-display %}

You are responsible for meeting any legal obligations that accompany the viewing or storage of IP addresses displayed within your organization's audit log.

{% ifversion enterprise-audit-log-ip-addresses %}

Alternatively, you can configure IP addresses at the enterprise level. For more information, see "[Displaying IP addresses in the audit log for your enterprise](/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/displaying-ip-addresses-in-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)."

{% endif %}

{% data reusables.audit_log.users-agree-to-ip-collection %}

After you enable the feature, you can access the audit log to view events that include IP addresses. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization)."

## Events that display IP addresses in the audit log

{% data variables.product.product_name %} displays an IP address for each event in the organization audit log that meets these criteria.

* The actor is an organization member or owner
* The target is either an organization-owned repository that is private or internal, or an organization resource that is not a repository, such as a project.

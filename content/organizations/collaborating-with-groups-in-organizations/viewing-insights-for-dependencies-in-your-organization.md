## Viewing organization dependency insights

Dependency insights can help you track, report, and act on your organization's open source usage.

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure you have enabled the [Dependency Graph](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/configuring-the-dependency-graph).

With dependency insights you can view vulnerabilities, licenses, and other important information for the open source projects your organization depends on.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.insights %}
1. Optionally, to view dependency insights for all your organizations, click **My organizations**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Dependency insights" page. A button, labeled "My organizations," is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/organizations/org-insights-dependencies-my-orgs-button.png)
1. To filter by a vulnerability status, a license, or a combination of the two, click the results in the **Open security advisories** and **Licenses** graphs.
1. To see which dependents in your organization are using each library, next to a vulnerability, click **{% octicon "package" aria-hidden-"true" %} X dependents**.

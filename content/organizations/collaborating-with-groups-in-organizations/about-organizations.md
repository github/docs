## About organizations

{% data reusables.organizations.about-organizations %} For more information about account types, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

You can invite people to join your organization, then give these organization members a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its data. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)." If an organization exceeds 100,000 members, some UI experiences and API functionality may be degraded.

In addition to managing access to the organization itself, you can separately manage access to your organization's repositories, projects, and apps. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization)", {% ifversion projects-v1 %}"[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)",{% endif %} and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization)."

To simplify access management and enhance collaboration, you can create nested teams that reflect your group's structure, with cascading access permissions and mentions. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

You can configure the organization to meet the unique needs of your group by managing settings, such as restricting the types of repositories that members can create. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings)."

To harden your organization's security, you can enforce security requirements and review the organization's audit log. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure)."

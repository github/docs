## About member reinstatement

If a user is removed from your organization in one of the following ways, the user's access privileges and settings are saved for three months.

* You manually removed the user from your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/removing-a-member-from-your-organization)."
{%- ifversion ghec %}
* The user was removed via SCIM. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-scim-for-organizations)."
{%- endif %}
* The user was removed from your organization because you've required members and outside collaborators to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)."{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
* The user was removed from your organization because you enforced SAML single sign-on. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization){% ifversion fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}{% endif %}
* You converted an organization member to an outside collaborator. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator)."

You can restore the user's privileges if you {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}invite{% else %}add{% endif %} them back to the organization within that time frame.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/articles/about-per-user-pricing)."
{% endif %}

## Items that are restored for reinstated members

When you reinstate a former organization member, the following items can be restored:

* The user's role in the organization
* Any private forks of repositories owned by the organization
* Membership in the organization's teams
* Previous access and permissions for the organization's repositories
* Stars for organization repositories
* Issue assignments in the organization
* Repository subscriptions (notification settings for watching, not watching, or ignoring a repository's activity)

## Reinstating a former member of your organization

The correct way to reinstate a former member depends on your organization's identity and access management configuration.

* If the user was removed via SCIM because they were unassigned from the {% data variables.product.product_name %} application in your IdP, re-invite the user via SCIM by re-assigning them to the application. The user's organization membership will be reinstated after they sign into {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and accept the invitation.
* If your organization uses SAML but not SCIM, ask the user to authenticate via SAML single sign-on, via your IP or by signing into {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, navigating to the organization, and clicking the banner to authenticate via SAML single sign-on. The user's organization membership will be reinstated after they successfully authenticate.
* Otherwise, invite the user to rejoin your organization on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, following the steps below.

{% warning %}

**Warnings:**
* You can change a team's permission level if the team has direct access to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. If the team's access to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team's access to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}.
* If you add or remove {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} access for a parent team, each of that parent's child teams will also receive or lose access to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

{% endwarning %}

## Giving a team access to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}

You can give an entire team the same permission level to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}.

{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.project-management.cascading-permissions %} For example, if an organization owner has given a team read permissions to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}, and a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} admin gives one of the team members admin permissions to that board as an individual collaborator, that person would have admin permissions to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %}. For more information see, "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/project-board-permissions-for-an-organization)."

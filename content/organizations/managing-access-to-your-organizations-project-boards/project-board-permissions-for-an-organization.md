## Permissions overview

There are three levels of permissions to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} for people and teams:

{% data reusables.project-management.project-board-permissions %}

Organization owners and people with admin permissions can give a person access to an organization {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} individually, as an outside collaborator or organization member, or through their membership in a team or organization. An outside collaborator is someone who is not an organization member but given permissions to collaborate in your organization.

Organization owners and people with admin permissions to a {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} can also:
* Set default {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} permissions for all organization members.
* Manage access to the {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} for organization members, teams, and outside collaborators. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-project-board)", "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-project-board)", or "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members)."
* Manage {% data variables.projects.projects_v1_board %} visibility. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards/managing-access-to-a-project-board-for-organization-members)."

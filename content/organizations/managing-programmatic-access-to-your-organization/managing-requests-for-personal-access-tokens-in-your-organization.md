## About {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %} requests

When organization members create a {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %} to access resources owned by the organization, if the organization requires approval for {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %}s, then an organization owner must approve the token before it can be used to access any resources that are not public. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization)."

{% data variables.product.company_short %} will notify organization owners with a daily email about all {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %}s that are awaiting approval. When a token is denied or approved, the user who created the token will receive an email notification.

{% note %}

**Note**: Only {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %}s, not {% data variables.product.pat_v1_plural %}, are subject to approval. Unless the organization has restricted access by {% data variables.product.pat_v1_plural %}, any {% data variables.product.pat_v1 %} can access organization resources without prior approval. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization)."

Organization owners can also use the REST API to review and manage {% data variables.product.pat_v2 %} requests. These endpoints can only be called by {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, and cannot be called with {% data variables.product.pat_generic_plural %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/orgs#list-requests-to-access-organization-resources-with-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens)."

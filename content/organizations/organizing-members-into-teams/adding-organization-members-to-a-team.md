## Mapping teams to LDAP groups (for instances using LDAP Sync for user authentication)

You can create a team with LDAP Sync enabled. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team#creating-teams-with-ldap-sync-enabled).

A team that's synced to an LDAP group is indicated with a special LDAP badge. The member list for an LDAP synced team can only be managed from the LDAP group it's mapped to. See [AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync).

To add a new member to a team synced to an LDAP group, add the user as a member of the LDAP group, or contact your LDAP administrator.

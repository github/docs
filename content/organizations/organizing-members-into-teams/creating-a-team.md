1. Optionally, if your organization or enterprise account uses team synchronization or your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, connect an identity provider group to your team.
    * If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, use the "Identity Provider Groups" drop-down menu, and select a single identity provider group to connect to the new team. For more information, [AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/managing-team-memberships-with-identity-provider-groups).
    * If your organization or enterprise account uses team synchronization, under "Identity Provider Groups," select the **Select Groups** dropdown menu, and click up to five identity provider groups to connect to the new team.

## Creating teams with LDAP Sync enabled

Instances using LDAP for user authentication can use LDAP Sync to manage a team's members. Setting the group's **Distinguished Name** (DN) in the **LDAP group** field will map a team to an LDAP group on your LDAP server. If you use LDAP Sync to manage a team's members, you won't be able to manage your team within {% data variables.location.product_location %}. The mapped team will sync its members in the background and periodically at the interval configured when LDAP Sync is enabled. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync).

You must be a site admin and an organization owner to create a team with LDAP sync enabled.

{% data reusables.enterprise_user_management.ldap-sync-nested-teams %}

> [!NOTE]
> * LDAP Sync only manages the team's member list. You must manage the team's repositories and permissions from within {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}.
> * If an LDAP group mapping to a DN is removed, such as if the LDAP group is deleted, then every member is removed from the synced {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} team. To fix this, map the team to a new DN, add the team members back, and [manually sync the mapping](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#manually-syncing-ldap-accounts).
> * When LDAP Sync is enabled, if a person is removed from a repository, they will lose access but their forks will not be deleted. If the person is added to a team with access to the original organization repository within three months, their access to the forks will be automatically restored on the next sync.

1. Ensure that [LDAP Sync is enabled](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync).
{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.new_team %}
{% data reusables.organizations.team_name %}
1. Under "LDAP group," search for an LDAP group's DN to map the team to. If you don't know the DN, type the LDAP group's name. {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} will search for and autocomplete any matches.

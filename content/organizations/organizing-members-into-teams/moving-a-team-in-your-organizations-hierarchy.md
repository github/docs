Organization owners can change the parent of any team. Team maintainers can change a team's parent if they are maintainers in both the child team and the parent team. Team maintainers without maintainer permissions in the child team can request to add a parent or child team. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-or-change-a-parent-team)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-a-child-team)."

{% data reusables.organizations.child-team-inherits-permissions %}

{% tip %}

**Tips:**
* You cannot change a team's parent to a secret team. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."
* You cannot nest a parent team beneath one of its child teams.

#  Team maintainers and organization owners can enable or disable notifications for specific teams. When notifications are enabled, members of the team will receive notifications when the team is mentioned in an issue, pull request, or comment.¡[💌]'(https://github.com/github/docs/edit/main/content/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/configuring-team-notifications.md)*

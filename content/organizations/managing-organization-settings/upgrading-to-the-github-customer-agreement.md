The Standard Terms of Service is an agreement between {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} and you as an individual. To enter into an agreement with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit, or group, organization owners can upgrade to the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Customer Agreement.

You can upgrade to the {% data variables.product.company_short %} Customer Agreement instead of using the Standard Terms of Service to help prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

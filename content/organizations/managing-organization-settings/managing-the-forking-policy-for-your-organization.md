By default, new organizations are configured to disallow the forking of private{% ifversion ghes or ghec %} and internal{% endif %} repositories.

If you allow forking of private{% ifversion ghes or ghec %} and internal{% endif %} repositories at the organization level, you can also configure the ability to fork a specific private{% ifversion ghes or ghec %} or internal{% endif %} repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-repository)."

{% ifversion org-owners-limit-forks-creation %}
{% ifversion ghec %}If your organization is owned by an enterprise account, you{% else %}You{% endif %} may not be able to configure this setting for your organization, if an enterprise owner has set a policy at the enterprise level. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-forking-private-or-internal-repositories)."{% endif %}

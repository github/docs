## About commit signoffs

To affirm that a commit complies with the rules and licensing governing a repository, many organizations require developers to sign off on every commit. If your organization requires commit signoffs, you can make signing off a seamless part of the commit process by enabling compulsory commit signoffs for users committing through {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s web interface. After you enable compulsory commit signoffs for an organization, every commit made to repositories in that organization through {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s web interface will automatically be signed off on by the commit author.

People with admin access to a repository can also enable compulsory commit signoffs at the repository level. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository)."

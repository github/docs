## About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} permissions for your organization

{% data reusables.actions.disabling-github-actions %} For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions)."

You can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for all repositories in your organization. {% data reusables.actions.enabled-actions-description %} You can disable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for all repositories in your organization. {% data reusables.actions.disabled-actions-description %}

Alternatively, you can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for all repositories in your organization but limit the actions {% ifversion actions-workflow-policy %}and reusable workflows{% endif %} a workflow can run.

## Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} permissions for your organization

You can choose to disable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for all repositories in your organization, or only allow specific repositories. You can also limit the use of public actions{% ifversion actions-workflow-policy %} and reusable workflows{% endif %}, so that people can only use local actions {% ifversion actions-workflow-policy %}and reusable workflows{% endif %} that exist in your {% ifversion ghec or ghes %}enterprise{% else %}organization{% endif %}.

{% note %}

**Note:** You might not be able to manage these settings if your organization is managed by an enterprise that has overriding policy. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise)."

{% endnote %}

## Limiting the use of self-hosted runners

{% data reusables.actions.disable-selfhosted-runners-overview %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}

{% note %}

**Note**: If your organization belongs to an enterprise, creation of self-hosted runners at the repository level may have been disabled as an enterprise-wide setting. If this has been done, you cannot enable repository-level self-hosted runners in your organization settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise)."

{% endnote %}

{% endif %}

If a repository already has self-hosted runners when you disable their use, these will be listed with the status "Disabled" and they will not be assigned any new workflow jobs.

## Configuring required approval for workflows from public forks

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-run-approve-public-fork %}

You can configure this behavior for an organization using the procedure below. Modifying this setting overrides the configuration set at the enterprise level.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions-general %}
{% data reusables.actions.workflows-from-public-fork-setting %}

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-run-approve-link %}
{% endif %}

{% ifversion required-workflows-deprecation %}

## Adding a required workflow to an organization

{% data reusables.actions.workflows.required-workflow-beta %}

You can configure required workflows to run in all or selected repositories in an organization where you are an owner. Required workflows are triggered by {% ifversion actions-required-workflow-improvements %}`pull_request` and `pull_request_target` default events{% else %}pull requests{% endif %} and must pass before a pull request can be merged. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/required-workflows)."

### Prerequisites

Before configuring a required workflow, note the following prerequisites:

{% data reusables.actions.workflows.required-workflow-prerequisites %}

### Restrictions and behaviors for the source repository

Note the following restrictions and behaviors for the source repository and workflow:

{% data reusables.actions.workflows.required-workflow-source-notes %}

### Restrictions and behaviors for the target repository

Note the following restrictions and behaviors for the target repositories:

{% data reusables.actions.workflows.required-workflow-target-notes %}

### Configuring a required workflow for your organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions-general %}
1. To the right of "Required Workflows", click **Add workflow**.

1. Under "Required workflow", use the drop-down menu to select the repository that contains the workflow. Then, enter the path to the workflow in the text field. {% ifversion actions-required-workflow-improvements %}You can reference any branch, tag, or commit SHA from the repository containing the workflow file using the `{path}@{ref}` syntax.{% endif %}

1. Under "Apply to repositories...", use the drop-down menu to select which repositories the required workflow applies to. Select **All repositories** to apply the required workflow to all repositories in your organization, or **Selected repositories** to choose which repositories it will apply to.

1. Optionally, if you chose "Selected repositories", click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="The Gear icon" %} to open the repository selection modal, then use the checkboxes to select the repositories, and click **Apply selection**. You can use filters to narrow down your search.

1. To add the required workflow, click **Add workflow**.

## Enabling workflows for private repository forks

{% data reusables.actions.private-repository-forks-overview %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes %}If a policy is disabled for an enterprise, it cannot be enabled for organizations.{% endif %} If a policy is disabled for an organization, it cannot be enabled for repositories. If an organization enables a policy, the policy can be disabled for individual repositories.

{% data reusables.actions.private-repository-forks-options %}

### Configuring the private fork policy for an organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions-general %}
{% data reusables.actions.private-repository-forks-configure %}

## Setting the permissions of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for your organization

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-permissions-intro %}

You can set the default permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the settings for your organization or your repositories. If you select a restrictive option as the default in your organization settings, the same option is selected in the settings for repositories within your organization, and the permissive option is disabled. If your organization belongs to a {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} account and a more restrictive default has been selected in the enterprise settings, you won't be able to select the more permissive default in your organization settings.

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-permissions-modifying %}

### Configuring the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions

{% ifversion actions-default-workflow-permissions-restrictive %}
By default, when you create a new organization,{% ifversion ghec or ghes %} the setting is inherited from what is configured in the enterprise settings.{% else %} `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has read access for the `contents` and `packages` scopes.{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions-general %}
{% data reusables.actions.workflows.github-token-access %}
1. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

{% ifversion allow-actions-to-approve-pr %}

### Preventing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} from {% ifversion allow-actions-to-approve-pr-with-ent-repo %}creating or {% endif %}approving pull requests

{% data reusables.actions.workflow-pr-approval-permissions-intro %}

By default, when you create a new organization, workflows are not allowed to {% ifversion allow-actions-to-approve-pr-with-ent-repo %}create or {% endif %}approve pull requests.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.settings-sidebar-actions-general %}
1. Under "Workflow permissions", use the **Allow GitHub Actions to {% ifversion allow-actions-to-approve-pr-with-ent-repo %}create and {% endif %}approve pull requests** setting to configure whether `GITHUB_TOKEN` can {% ifversion allow-actions-to-approve-pr-with-ent-repo %}create and {% endif %}approve pull requests.
1. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

{% endif %}

## Managing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} cache storage for your organization

Organization administrators can view {% ifversion actions-cache-admin-ui %}and manage {% endif %}{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} cache storage for all repositories in the organization.

### Viewing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} cache storage by repository

For each repository in your organization, you can see how much cache storage a repository is using, the number of active caches, and if a repository is near the total cache size limit. For more information about the cache usage and eviction process, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy)."

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}

{% ifversion actions-cache-admin-ui %}

### Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} cache storage for your organization

{% data reusables.actions.cache-default-size %}

You can configure the size limit for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} caches that will apply to each repository in your organization. The cache size limit for an organization cannot exceed the cache size limit set in the enterprise policy. Repository admins will be able to set a smaller limit in their repositories.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}

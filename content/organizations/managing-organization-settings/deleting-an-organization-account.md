## About deletion of your organization account

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

> [!TIP]
> If you want to cancel your paid subscription, you can [downgrade your organization to {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %}](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) instead of deleting the organization and its content.

{% endif %}
Deleting your organization account removes all repositories, forks of private repositories, wikis, issues, pull requests, and project or organization pages. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}Your billing will end and, after 90 days, the organization name becomes available for use on a new user or organization account.

> [!TIP]
> If you rename an organization, you can create a new organization with the same name immediately. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/renaming-an-organization).

## About custom properties

Custom properties allow you to decorate your repositories with information such as compliance frameworks, data sensitivity, or project details. Custom properties are private and can only be viewed by people with read permissions to the repository.

{% ifversion ghec or ghes  %}
You can use repository properties to determine which repositories to target with a ruleset. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization#targeting-repositories-by-properties-in-your-organization)."
{% endif %}

## Allowed characters

Custom property names and values may only contain certain characters:

* Names: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `$`, `#`.
* Values: All printable ASCII characters except `"`.

## Adding custom properties

You can add custom properties to your organization and set values for those properties for repositories in your organization.

{% ifversion ghec %}You can also use the REST API to create and manage custom properties for an organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/orgs/custom-properties)."{% endif %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
{% data reusables.organizations.access-custom-properties %}
1. To add a new custom property, click **New property** in the upper right corner.
1. In the "Name" field, type the name you'd like to use for your custom property. The name can't contain spaces.
1. Optionally, in the "Description" field, fill in a description of your custom property.
1. Under "Type", select the type of property you'd like to add. This can either be a text string, a single select field, a multi select field, or a true/false boolean.
1. Optionally, you can select **Allow repository actors to set this property**. When enabled, repository users and apps with the repository-level "custom properties" fine-grained permission will be able to set and update the property value for their repository.
1. Optionally, you can select **Require this property for all repositories** and add a default value. This means that you require that all repositories in your organization have a value for this property. Repositories that donâ€™t have an explicit value for this property will inherit the default value.
1. Click **Save property**.

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click **{% octicon "tools" aria-hidden="true"%} Custom properties**.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_org %}
1. Under your organization name, click {% octicon "repo" aria-hidden="true" %} **Repositories**.
1. In the search bar, type `prop` to see a list of all custom properties in your organization, and select the property you'd like to search by.

{% warning %}

**Warning:**
* When removing an outside collaborator from a private repository, the paid license count does not automatically downgrade. To pay for fewer licenses after removing users from your organization, follow the steps in "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan)."

* You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property.

{% endwarning %}

{% endif %}

While forks of private repositories are deleted when a collaborator is removed, the person will still retain any local clones of your repository.

{% data reusables.organizations.people %}
{% data reusables.organizations.people_tab_outside_collaborators %}
1. To the right of the username of the person you want to remove, select the {% octicon "gear" aria-label="Collaborator settings" %} dropdown menu, and click **Manage**.

1. To completely remove the outside collaborator's access to the repository, in the upper right corner, click **Remove access to this repository**.

## About conversion of organization members to outside collaborators

You can convert a member of an organization to an outside collaborator. For more information about outside collaborators, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}If the organization is owned by an enterprise, converting{% elsif ghes %}Converting{% endif %} an organization member to an outside collaborator may be restricted. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise]({% ifversion fpt %}/enterprise-cloud@latest{% endif %}/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}outside-{% endif %}collaborators-to-repositories){% ifversion ghec or ghes %}."{% elsif fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% endif %}

After converting an organization member to an outside collaborator, they'll only have access to the repositories that their current team membership allows. The person will no longer be an explicit member of the organization, and will no longer be able to:

* Create teams
* See all organization members and teams
* @mention any visible team
* Be a team maintainer

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization)."

We recommend reviewing the organization member's access to repositories to ensure their access is as you expect. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository)."

When you convert an organization member to an outside collaborator, their privileges as organization members are saved for three months so that you can restore their membership privileges if you{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} invite them to rejoin{% else %} add them back to{% endif %} your organization within that time frame. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization)."

## About access to organization repositories

When you remove a collaborator from a repository in your organization, the collaborator loses read and write access to the repository. If the repository is private and the collaborator has forked the repository, then their fork is also deleted, but the collaborator will still retain any local clones of your repository.

## Managing an individual's access to an organization repository

You can give a person access to a repository or change a person's level of access to a repository in your repository settings.

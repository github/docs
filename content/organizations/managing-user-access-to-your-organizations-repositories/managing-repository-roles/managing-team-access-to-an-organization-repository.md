People with admin access to a repository can manage team access to the repository. Team maintainers can remove a team's access to a repository if the team has direct access to it. If the team's access to the repository is inherited from a parent team, maintainers can choose to reset the current permission to match the parent team's permission.

{% warning %}

**Warnings:**
* You can change a team's permission level if the team has direct access to a repository. If the team's access to the repository is inherited from a parent team, you must change the parent team's access to the repository.
* If you add or remove repository access for a parent team, each of that parent's child teams will also receive or lose access to the repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

{% endwarning %}

## Removing a team's access to a repository

You can remove a team's access to an organization repository in your repository settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository#removing-access-for-a-team-or-person)."

If a team has direct access to a repository, you can remove that team's access to the repository. If a team's access to the repository is inherited from a parent team, you must remove the repository from the parent team in order to remove the repository from child teams.

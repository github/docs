## Changing your organization's profile picture

When you create an organization, {% data variables.product.github %} provides you with a randomly generated "identicon." The identicon is generated from a hash of your organization's user ID, so there's no way to control its color or pattern.

You can replace the identicon with an image that represents your organization. To replace the image, you can upload a new image or use a Gravatar image.

### Uploading an image

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
1. Under your profile picture, click **Upload new picture**, then select an image.

### Using a Gravatar image

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
1. In the "Gravatar email (Private)" field, enter the email address associated with your Gravatar image.
1. Click **Update profile**.

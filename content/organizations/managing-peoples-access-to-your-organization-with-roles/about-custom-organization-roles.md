You can create and assign custom organization roles in your organization's settings. You can also manage custom roles using the REST API. See "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-organization-roles)."

{% ifversion org-custom-role-with-repo-permissions %}

You can also create a custom organization role that includes permissions for repositories. Repository permissions grant access to all current and future repositories in the organization. There are several ways to combine permissions for repositories and organizations. You can create a custom organization role with:

You can create a role that includes permissions for organization settings, a base role for repository access, or both. If you add a base role for repository access, you can also include additional repository permissions. You can't create a role with repository permissions unless it includes a base repository role. Without repository permissions or a base repository role, the organization role doesn't grant access to any repositories.

>[!NOTE] Adding repository permissions to a custom organization role is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

{% endif %}

To grant access to **specific** repositories in your organization, you can create a custom repository role. See "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)."

## Permissions for organization access

When you include a permission in a custom organization role, any users with that role will have access to the corresponding settings via both the web browser and API. In the organization's settings in the browser, users will see only the pages for settings they can access.

Organization permissions do not grant read, write, or administrator access to any repositories. Some permissions may implicitly grant visibility of repository metadata, as marked in the table below.

## Base roles for repository access

The base repository role determines the initial set of permissions included in the custom role. Repository access is granted across **all** current and future repositories in the organization.

The base repository roles are:

* **Read**: Grants read access to all repositories in the organization.
* **Write**: Grants write access to all repositories in the organization.
* **Triage**: Grants triage access to all repositories in the organization.
* **Maintain**: Grants maintenance access to all repositories in the organization.
* **Admin**: Grants admin access to all repositories in the organization.

## Additional permissions for repository access

After choosing a base repository role, you can select additional permissions for your custom organization role.

You can only choose an additional permission if it's not already included in the base repository role. For example, if the base role offers **Write** access to a repository, then the "Close a pull request" permission will already be included in the base role.

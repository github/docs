## About organization moderators

Sometimes it's necessary to block a contributor, or to set up interaction limits for your organization, or for individual repositories. As an organization owner, you can perform these tasks, but you may want to delegate these tasks to other members of your organization. You can do this by assigning an organization member, or a team, to the moderator role.

Organization moderators can:
* Block and unblock users from the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization)."
* Manage organization interaction limits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-organization)."
* Manage repository interaction limits. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository)."
* Hide comments in all public repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-disruptive-comments)."

Making someone an organization moderator does not give them additional abilities other than those listed above. For example, someone who only has read access to a repository will not gain write access by being made a moderator.

You can add up to 10 individual people, or teams, as moderators. If you've already assigned 10 individuals and/or teams as users and you want to add more, you can group people in a moderators team and then use this to replace one or more of the existing assignments. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team)."

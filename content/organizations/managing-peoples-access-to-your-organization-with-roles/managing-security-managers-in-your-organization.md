## Permissions for the security manager role

Members of a team with the security manager role have only the permissions required to effectively manage code security for the organization.

* Read access on all repositories in the organization, in addition to any existing repository access
* Write access on all security alerts in the organization {% ifversion not fpt %}
* Access to view and configure all repositories in the organization's security overview {% endif %}
* The ability to configure code security settings at the organization level{% ifversion not fpt %}, including the ability to enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}{% endif %}
* The ability to configure code security settings at the repository level{% ifversion not fpt %}, including the ability to enable or disable {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %}{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
Additional functionality, including a security overview for the organization, is available in organizations that use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_advanced_security %}. For more information, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization).
{% endif %}

If a team has the security manager role, people with admin access to the team and a specific repository can change the team's level of access to that repository but cannot remove the access. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository)."

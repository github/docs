Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides basic authentication for organization members. By enabling 2FA, organization owners limit the likelihood that a member's account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} could be compromised. For more information on 2FA, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication).

To add additional authentication measures, organization owners can also [enable SAML single sign-on (SSO)](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/enabling-and-testing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization) so that organization members must use single sign-on to access an organization. For more information on SAML SSO, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).

If both 2FA and SAML SSO are enabled, organization members must do the following:
* Use 2FA to log in to their account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}
* Use single sign-on to access the organization
* Use an authorized token for API or Git access and use single sign-on to authorize the token

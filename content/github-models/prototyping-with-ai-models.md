If you want to develop a generative AI application, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %} to find and experiment with AI models for free. Once you are ready to bring your application to production, you can switch to a token from a paid Azure account. See the [Azure AI](https://aka.ms/azureai/github-models) documentation.

See also [AUTOTITLE](/github-models/responsible-use-of-github-models).

## Finding AI models

To find an AI model:

{% data reusables.models.steps-to-open-model-playground %}

The model is opened in the model playground. Details of the model are displayed in the sidebar on the right. If the sidebar is not displayed, expand it by clicking the **{% octicon "sidebar-expand" aria-label="Show parameters setting" %}** icon at the right of the playground.

{% data reusables.models.o1-models-preview-note %}

## Experimenting with AI models in the playground

The AI model playground is a free resource that allows you to adjust model parameters and submit prompts to see how a model responds.

>[!NOTE]
>
> * The model playground is in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.
> * The playground is rate limited. See [Rate limits](#rate-limits) below.

To adjust parameters for the model, in the playground, select the **Parameters** tab in the sidebar.

To see code that corresponds to the parameters that you selected, switch from the **Chat** tab to the **Code** tab.

### Comparing models

You can submit a prompt to two models at the same time and compare the responses.

With one model open in the playground, click **Compare**, then, in the dropdown menu, select a model for comparison. The selected model opens in a second chat window. When you type a prompt in either chat window, the prompt is mirrored to the other window. The prompts are submitted simultaneously so that you can compare the responses from each model.

Any parameters you set are used for both models.

## Experimenting with AI models using the API

>[!NOTE]
>
> The free API usage is in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

{% data variables.product.company_short %} provides free API usage so that you can experiment with AI models in your own application.

The steps to use each model are similar. In general, you will need to:

{% data reusables.models.steps-to-open-model-playground %}

   The model opens in the model playground.

1. Click the **Code** tab.
1. Optionally, use the language dropdown to select the programming language.
1. Optionally, use the SDK dropdown to select which SDK to use.

   All models can be used with the Azure AI Inference SDK, and some models support additional SDKs. If you want to easily switch between models, you should select "Azure AI Inference SDK". If you selected "REST" as the language, you won't use an SDK. Instead, you will use the API endpoint directly.
1. Either open a codespace, or set up your local environment:
   * To run in a codespace, click **{% octicon "codespaces" aria-hidden="true" %} Run codespace**, then click **Create new codespace**.
   * To run locally:
      * Create a {% data variables.product.company_short %} {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}. The token should not have any scopes or permissions. See [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
      * Save your token as an environment variable.
      * Install the dependencies for the SDK, if required.
1. Use the example code to make a request to the model.

The free API usage is rate limited. See [Rate limits](#rate-limits) below.

## Saving and sharing your playground experiments

You can save and share your progress in the playground with presets. Presets save:
* Your current state
* Your parameters
* Your chat history (optional)

To create a preset for your current context, select **Preset: PRESET-NAME** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} at the top right of the playground, then click **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" %} Create new preset**. You need to name your preset, and you can also choose to provide a preset description, include your chat history, and allow your preset to be shared.

There are two ways to load a preset:
* Select the **Preset: PRESET-NAME** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click the preset you want to load.
* Open a shared preset URL

After you load a preset, you can edit, share, or delete the preset:
* To edit the preset, change the parameters and prompt the model. Once you are satisfied with your changes, select the **Preset: PRESET-NAME** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click **{% octicon "pencil" aria-hidden="true" %} Edit preset** and save your updates.
* To share the preset, select the **Preset: PRESET-NAME** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click **{% octicon "share" aria-hidden="true" %} Share preset** to get a shareable URL.
* To delete the preset, select the **Preset: PRESET-NAME** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu, then click **{% octicon "trash" aria-hidden="true" %} Delete preset** and confirm the deletion.

## Using the prompt editor

The prompt editor in {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %} is designed to help you iterate, refine, and perfect your prompts. This dedicated view provides a focused and intuitive experience for crafting and testing inputs, enabling you to:

* Quickly test and refine prompts without the complexity of multi-turn interactions.
* Fine-tune prompts for precision and relevance in your projects.
* Use a specialized space for single-turn scenarios to ensure consistent and optimized results.

To access the prompt editor, click **{% octicon "stack" aria-hidden="true" %} Prompt editor** at the top right of the playground.

## Experimenting with AI models in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}

> [!NOTE] The AI Toolkit extension for {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} is in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and is subject to change.

If you prefer to experiment with AI models in your IDE, you can install the AI Toolkit extension for {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, then test models with adjustable parameters and context.

1. In {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, install the pre-release version of the [AI Toolkit for {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio).
1. To open the extension, click the AI Toolkit icon in the activity bar.
1. Authorize the AI Toolkit to connect to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account.
1. In the "My models" section of the AI Toolkit panel, click **Open Model Catalog**, then find a model to experiment with.
     * To use a model hosted remotely through {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %}, on the model card, click **Try in playground**.
     * To download and use a model locally, on the model card, click **Download**. Once the download is complete, on the same model card, click **Load in playground**.

1. In the sidebar, provide any context instructions and inference parameters for the model, then send a prompt.

## Going to production

The rate limits for the playground and free API usage are intended to help you experiment with models and develop your AI application. Once you are ready to bring your application to production, you can use a token from a paid Azure account instead of your {% data variables.product.company_short %} {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}. You don't need to change anything else in your code.

For more information, see the [Azure AI](https://aka.ms/azureai/github-models) documentation.

## Rate limits

The playground and free API usage are rate limited by requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests. If you get rate limited, you will need to wait for the rate limit that you hit to reset before you can make more requests.

Low, high, and embedding models have different rate limits. To see which type of model you are using, refer to the model's information in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

With {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %}, you build your understanding of AI model capabilities by experimenting with model settings and sending prompts through a chat interface. Additionally, you can directly interact with models through an SDK. Refer to a model's "Getting Started" tab for more information about how to use the SDK. Refer to a modelâ€™s "README" tab for more information on the model. Remember when interacting with a model you are experimenting with AI, so content mistakes are possible.

{% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %} is designed to allow for learning, experimentation and proof-of-concept activities. The feature is subject to various limits (including requests per minute, requests per day, tokens per request, and concurrent requests) and is not designed for production use cases. {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %} employs a number of [content filters](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety). These filters cannot be turned off as part of the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_models %} experience. If you decide to employ models through [Azure AI](https://ai.azure.com/github/model/docs) or a paid service, please configure your content filters to meet your requirements.

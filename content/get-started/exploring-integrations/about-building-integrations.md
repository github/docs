Integrations are tools that extend {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s functionality. Integrations can do things on {% data variables.product.company_short %} like open issues, comment on pull requests, and manage projects. They can also do things outside of {% data variables.product.company_short %} based on events that happen on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. For example, an integration can post on Slack when an issue is opened on {% data variables.product.company_short %}.

Many integrations are {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows, or custom actions for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows.

* {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %} are integrations that run on the app owner's server or on a user device. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps).
* {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows are workflows that run when specific events occur on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).
* Custom actions are code that can be executed by a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions).

Your integration can use {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s API to fetch data and make changes to data on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. {% data variables.product.company_short %} has a REST API and a GraphQL API. For more information, see:

* [AUTOTITLE](/rest/about-the-rest-api/comparing-githubs-rest-api-and-graphql-api)
* [AUTOTITLE](/rest)
* [AUTOTITLE](/graphql)

Your integration can use webhooks to learn when specific events happen on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/about-webhooks).

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If your integration is a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} or custom action, you can publish your integration on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/about-github-marketplace-for-apps) and [AUTOTITLE](/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
If your integration uses generative AI, you can find and experiment with AI models for free on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models).

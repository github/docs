You can discover, browse, and install free and paid tools, including {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}, and {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, in [{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](https://github.com/marketplace).

If you purchase a paid tool, you'll pay for your tool subscription with the same billing information you use to pay for your {% data variables.product.product_name %} subscription, and receive one bill on your regular billing date. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-marketplace-apps/about-billing-for-github-marketplace)."

You may also have the option to select a free 14-day trial on some tools. You can cancel at any time during your trial and you won't be charged, but you will automatically lose access to the tool. Your paid subscription will start at the end of the 14-day trial. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-marketplace-apps/about-billing-for-github-marketplace)."

Integrations are tools that extend {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s functionality. Integrations can do things on {% data variables.product.company_short %} like open issues, comment on pull requests, and manage projects. They can also do things outside of {% data variables.product.company_short %} based on events that happen on {% data variables.product.company_short %}. For example, an integration can post on Slack when an issue is opened on {% data variables.product.company_short %}.

You can discover many integrations in [{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](https://github.com/marketplace). {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} includes {% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_apps %}, and custom actions that you can use in {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows. You can also get integrations directly from the integration creator.

For a list of featured {% data variables.product.company_short %} integrations, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-integrations/featured-github-integrations)."

If you want your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance to use a third-party {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}, you can contact the app developer about making the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} available for {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/sharing-github-apps/making-your-github-app-available-for-github-enterprise-server)."

If you want your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance to use third-party custom actions, you need to enable {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect)."

## About writing mathematical expressions

To enable clear communication of mathematical expressions, {% data variables.product.github %} supports LaTeX formatted math within Markdown. For more information, see [LaTeX/Mathematics](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) in Wikibooks.

{% data variables.product.github %}'s math rendering capability uses MathJax; an open source, JavaScript-based display engine. MathJax supports a wide range of LaTeX macros, and several useful accessibility extensions. For more information, see [the MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/index.html#tex-and-latex-support) and [the MathJax Accessibility Extensions Documentation](https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-a11y/docs/#reader-guide).

Mathematical expressions rendering is available in {% data variables.product.prodname_github_issues %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, pull requests, wikis, and Markdown files.

## Writing inline expressions

There are two options for delimiting a math expression inline with your text. You can either surround the expression with dollar symbols (`$`), or start the expression with <code>$\`</code> and end it with <code>\`$</code>. The latter syntax is useful when the expression you are writing contains characters that overlap with markdown syntax. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

```text
This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
```

```text
This sentence uses $\` and \`$ delimiters to show math inline: $`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$
```

## Writing expressions as blocks

To add a math expression as a block, start a new line and delimit the expression with two dollar symbols `$$`.

>[!TIP] If you're writing in an .md file, you will need to use specific formatting to create a line break, such as ending the line with a backslash as shown in the example below. For more information on line breaks in Markdown, see [AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#line-breaks).

```text
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
```

Alternatively, you can use the <code>\`\`\`math</code> code block syntax to display a math expression as a block. With this syntax, you don't need to use `$$` delimiters. The following will render the same as above:

````text
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```
````

## Writing dollar signs in line with and within mathematical expressions

To display a dollar sign as a character in the same line as a mathematical expression, you need to escape the non-delimiter `$` to ensure the line renders correctly.

* Within a math expression, add a `\` symbol before the explicit `$`.

  ```text
  This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $`\sqrt{\$4}`$
  ```

  ![Screenshot of rendered Markdown showing how a backslash before a dollar sign displays the sign as part of a mathematical expression.](/assets/images/help/writing/dollar-sign-within-math-expression.png)

* Outside a math expression, but on the same line, use span tags around the explicit `$`.

  ```text
  To split <span>$</span>100 in half, we calculate $100/2$
  ```

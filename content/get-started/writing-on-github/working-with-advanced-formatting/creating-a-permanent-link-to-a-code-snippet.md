## Linking to code

This type of permanent link will render as a code snippet only in the repository it originated in. In other repositories, the permalink code snippet will render as a URL.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** To create a permalink for an entire file, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/getting-permanent-links-to-files)."

{% endtip %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. Locate the code you'd like to link to:
    * To link to code from a file, navigate to the file.
    * To link to code from a pull request, navigate to the pull request and click {% octicon "diff" aria-hidden="true" %} **Files changed**. Then, browse to the file that contains the code you want include in your comment, and click **View**.
{% data reusables.repositories.choose-line-or-range %}
1. To the left of the line or range of lines, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Code line X options" %}. In the drop-down menu, click **Copy permalink**.

   ![Screenshot of a file, with 8 lines selected. To the left of the first selected line, a button labeled with a kebab icon is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/open-new-issue-specific-line.png)
1. Navigate to the conversation where you want to link to the code snippet.
1. Paste your permalink into a comment, and click **Comment**.

## Linking to Markdown

You can link to specific lines in Markdown files by loading the Markdown file without Markdown rendering. To load a Markdown file without rendering, you can use the `?plain=1` parameter at the end of the url for the file. For example, `github.com/<organization>/<repository>/blob/<branch_name>/README.md?plain=1`.

You can link to a specific line in the Markdown file the same way you can in code. Append `#L` with the line number or numbers at the end of the url. For example, `github.com/<organization>/<repository>/blob/<branch_name>/README.md?plain=1#L14` will highlight line 14 in the plain README.md file.

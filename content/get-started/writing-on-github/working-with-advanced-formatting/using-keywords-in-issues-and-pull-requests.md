## Linking a pull request to an issue

To link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request, type one of the following keywords followed by a reference to the issue. For example, `Closes #10` or `Fixes octo-org/octo-repo#100`.

* close
* closes
* closed
* fix
* fixes
* fixed
* resolve
* resolves
* resolved

## Marking an issue or pull request as a duplicate

To mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate, type "Duplicate of" followed by the issue or pull request number it duplicates in the body of a new comment. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/marking-issues-or-pull-requests-as-a-duplicate)."

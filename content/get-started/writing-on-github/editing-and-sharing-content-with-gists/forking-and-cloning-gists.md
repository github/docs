## Forking gists

Each gist indicates which forks have activity, making it easy to find interesting changes from others.

## Cloning gists

If you want to make local changes to a gist and push them up to the web, you can clone a gist and make commits the same as you would with any Git repository. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)."

To clone a gist, select the Embed dropdown menu, then click **Clone via HTTPS** or **Clone via SSH**.

## Viewing gist commit history

To view a gist's full commit history, click the "Revisions" tab at the top of the gist.

You will see a full commit history for the gist with diffs.

## Starring a gist

You can star a gist to add it to the "Starred" page. Starring makes it easy to find a gist again later.

1. Navigate to {% data variables.gists.discover_url %} and select the gist you want to star.
1. To star the gist, click {% octicon "star" aria-hidden="true" %} **Star** in the top-right corner of the page.

1. Optionally, to unstar a previously starred gist, click {% octicon "star-fill" aria-hidden="true" %} **Unstar**. This will remove the gist from your starred list.

## Viewing your starred gists

Starring makes it easy to find a gist again later. You can see all the gists you've starred by navigating to {% data variables.gists.gist_user_starred %}.

Alternatively, follow the steps in the procedure.

1. Navigate to your {% data variables.gists.gist_homepage %}.
1. In the top right corner, click your profile picture.
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Starred gists**.

You can see all recently starred gists from other users by going to the {% data variables.gists.gist_starred %}.

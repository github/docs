You can search, sort, and filter your starred repositories and topics on your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %}.

## About stars

Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your {% data variables.explore.your_stars_page %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
You can star repositories and topics to discover similar projects on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you star repositories or topics, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may recommend related content on your personal dashboard. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#staying-updated-with-activity-from-the-community)."
{% endif %}

Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. In addition, [Explore {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](https://github.com/explore) shows popular repositories based on the number of stars they have.

## Starring a repository

Starring a repository is a simple two-step process.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Star**.

1. Optionally, to unstar a previously starred repository, click **Starred**. This will remove the repository from your starred list.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Viewing who has starred a repository

You can view everyone who has starred a public repository or a private repository you have access to.

To view everyone who has starred a repository, add `/stargazers` to the end of the URL of a repository. For example, to view stargazers for the github/docs repository, visit https://github.com/github/docs/stargazers.

## Organizing starred repositories with lists

{% note %}

**Note:** Lists are currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

Curate repositories that you've starred with public lists. You can create public lists that appear on your stars page at `https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=stars`.

![Screenshot the "Stars" tab of Octocat's profile. Two named lists of stars are displayed.](/assets/images/help/stars/lists-overview-on-stars-page.png)

If you add a private repository to a list, then the private repository will only appear in your list for people with `read` access to the repository.

You can add a repository to an existing or new list wherever you see a repository's **Star** or **Starred** dropdown menu, whether on a repository page or in a list of starred repositories.

![Screenshot of a repository page. The "Star" dropdown menu is expanded, with a list options highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/stars/stars-dropdown-on-repo.png)

{% data reusables.stars.stars-page-navigation %}

The search bar only searches based on the name of a repository or topic, and not on any other qualifiers (such as the size of the repository or when it was last updated).

You can use sorting or filtering to customize how you see starred repositories and topics on your stars page.

{% data reusables.stars.stars-page-navigation %}

1. To filter your list of stars based on their language, click on the desired language under the **Language** dropdown menu.
1. To filter your list of stars based on repository type, click on the desired option under the **Type:** dropdown menu.

## About branch and tag names

Most repositories use simple branch names, such as `main` or `update-icons`. Tag names also usually follow a basic format, such as a version number like `v1.2.3`. Both branch names and tag names may also use the path separator (`/`) for structure, for example `area/item` or `level-1/level-2/level-3`. Other than some exceptions &mdash; such as not starting or ending a name with a slash, or having consecutive slashes in the name &mdash; Git has very few restrictions on what characters may be used in branch and tag names. For more information, see "[git-check-ref-format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format)" in the Git documentation.

## Why you need to escape special characters

When using a CLI, you might have situations where a branch or tag name contains special characters that have a special meaning for your shell environment. To use these characters safely in a Git command, they must be quoted or escaped, otherwise the command may have unintended effects.

For example, the `$` character is used by many shells to refer to a variable. Most shells would interpret a valid branch name like `hello-$USER` as equivalent to the word "hello", followed by a hyphen, followed by the current value of the `USER` variable, rather than the literal string `hello-$USER`. If a branch name includes the `$` character, then the shell must be stopped from expanding it as a variable reference. Similarly, if a branch name contains a semi-colon (`;`), most shells interpret it as a command separator, so it needs to be quoted or escaped.

## How to escape special characters in branch and tag names

Most branch and tag names with special characters can be handled by including the name in single quotes, for example `'hello-$USER'`.

* In the [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell, enclosing a string of characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of the characters within the single quotes.
* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) behaves similar to Bash, however this behavior is configurable using the `RC_QUOTES` option.
* [PowerShell](https://microsoft.com/powershell) also treats characters literally when inside single quotes.

For these shells, the main exception is when the branch or tag name itself contains a single quote. In this case, you should consult the official documentation for your shell:

* [Bash documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)
* [Zsh documentation](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/)
* [Fish documentation](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/)
* [PowerShell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/)

## Naming branches and tags

If possible, create branch and tag names that don't contain special characters, as these would need to be escaped. A safe default set of characters to use for branch names and tag names is:

* The English alphabet (`a` to `z` and `A` to `Z`)
* Numbers (`0` to `9`)
* A limited set of punctuation characters:
  * period (`.`)
  * hyphen (`-`)
  * underscore (`_`)
  * forward slash (`/`)

To avoid confusion, you should start branch names with a letter.

## Restrictions on names in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} restricts a small number of branch and tag names from being pushed up.
Those restrictions are:
* No names which look like Git object IDs (40 characters containing only 0-9 and A-F), to prevent confusion with actual Git object IDs.
* No names beginning with `refs/`, to prevent confusion with the full name of Git refs. For more information about refs, see "[Git References](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)" in the Git documentation.

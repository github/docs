title: Resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase
intro: 'When you perform a `git rebase` operation, you''re typically moving commits around. Because of this, you might get into a situation where a merge conflict is introduced. That means that two of your commits modified the same line in the same file, and Git doesn''t know which change to apply.'

shortTitle: Resolve conflicts after rebase
---
After you reorder and manipulate commits using `git rebase`, should a merge conflict occur, Git will tell you so with the following message printed to the terminal:

```shell
error: could not apply fa39187... something to add to patch A

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply fa39187f3c3dfd2ab5faa38ac01cf3de7ce2e841... Change fake file
```

Here, Git is telling you which commit is causing the conflict (`fa39187`). You're given three choices:

* You can run `git rebase --abort` to completely undo the rebase. Git will return you to your branch's state as it was before `git rebase` was called.
* You can run `git rebase --skip` to completely skip the commit. That means that none of the changes introduced by the problematic commit will be included. It is very rare that you would choose this option.
* You can fix the conflict.

To fix the conflict, you can follow [the standard procedures for resolving merge conflicts from the command line](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line). When you're finished, you'll need to call `git rebase --continue` in order for Git to continue processing the rest of the rebase.

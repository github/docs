{% data reusables.subversion.sunset %}

## Executable files (`svn:executable`)

We convert `svn:executable` properties by updating the file mode directly before adding it to the Git repository.

## MIME types (`svn:mime-type`)

{% data variables.product.product_name %} internally tracks the mime-type properties of files and the commits that added them.

## Ignoring unversioned items (`svn:ignore`)

If you've set files and directories to be ignored in Subversion, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will track them internally. Files ignored by subversion clients are completely distinct from entries in a _.gitignore_ file.

## Currently unsupported properties

{% data variables.product.product_name %} doesn't currently support `svn:externals`, `svn:global-ignores`, or any properties not listed above, including custom properties.

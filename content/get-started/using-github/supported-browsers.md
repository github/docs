* [Mozilla Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox)

If you do not use the latest version of a recommended browser, or if you use a browser that is not listed above, {% data variables.product.product_name %} or some features may not work as you expect, or at all.

For more information about how we maintain browser compatibility for {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s products, see the [`github/browser-support`](https://github.com/github/browser-support) repository.

## Extended support for recommended web browsers

Some browser vendors provide extended support releases. We do our best to ensure that {% data variables.product.product_name %} functions properly in the latest extended support release for:

## {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview_caps %} and developer builds

You may encounter unexpected bugs in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and developer builds of our supported browsers. If you encounter a bug on {% data variables.product.product_name %} in one of these unreleased builds, please verify that it also exists in the stable version of the same browser. If the bug only exists in the unstable version, consider reporting the bug to the browser developer.

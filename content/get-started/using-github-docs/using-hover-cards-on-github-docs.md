## About hover cards

When you're reading an article on {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %} and find a link to another article, you can open a hover card to get more information about the article. The hover card provides basic information about the article, so you can determine whether it will be useful to you without leaving the article you're reading.

If you navigate {% data variables.product.prodname_docs %} with a mouse, the hover card is displayed when you hover the cursor over a link.

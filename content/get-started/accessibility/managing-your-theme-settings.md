For choice and flexibility in how and when you use {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can configure theme settings to change how {% data variables.product.product_name %} looks to you. You can choose from themes that are light or dark, or you can configure {% data variables.product.product_name %} to follow your system settings.

You may want to use a dark theme to reduce power consumption on certain devices, to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions, or because you prefer how the theme looks.

If you have low vision, you may benefit from a high contrast theme, with greater contrast between foreground and background elements.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} If you have colorblindness, you may benefit from our light and dark colorblind themes.

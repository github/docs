## About the {% data variables.product.prodname_command_palette %}

You can navigate, search, and run commands on {% data variables.product.product_name %} with the {% data variables.product.prodname_command_palette %}. The command palette is an on-demand way to show suggestions based on your current context and resources you've used recently. You can open the command palette with a keyboard shortcut from anywhere on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, which saves you time and keeps your hands on the keyboard.

### Fast navigation

When you open the command palette, the suggestions are optimized to give you easy access from anywhere in a repository, personal account, or organization to top-level pages like the Issues page. If the location you want isn't listed, start entering the name or number for the location to refine the suggestions.

### Easy access to commands

The ability to run commands directly from your keyboard, without navigating through a series of menus, may change the way you use {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For example, you can switch themes with a few keystrokes, making it easy to toggle between themes as your needs change.

![Screenshot of the command palette. "switch theme to dark" is in the command palette input, and results for changing your theme are displayed.](/assets/images/help/command-palette/command-palette-command-change-theme.png)

## Opening the {% data variables.product.prodname_command_palette %}

Open the command palette using one of the following default keyboard shortcuts:
* Windows and Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>
* Mac: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>

You can customize the keyboard shortcuts you use to open the command palette in the [Accessibility section](https://github.com/settings/accessibility) of your user settings. For more information, see "[Customizing your {% data variables.product.prodname_command_palette %} keyboard shortcuts](#customizing-your-github-command-palette-keyboard-shortcuts)."

When you open the command palette, it shows your location at the top left and uses it as the scope for suggestions (for example, the `octo-org` organization).

![Screenshot of the command palette. "octo-org" is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/command-palette/command-palette-launch.png)

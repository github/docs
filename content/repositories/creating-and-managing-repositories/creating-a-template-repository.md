## Creating a template repository

To create a template repository, you must create a repository, then make the repository a template. For more information about creating a repository, see [AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

After you make your repository a template, anyone with access to the repository can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as your default branch. They can also choose to include all the other branches in your repository. Branches created from a template have unrelated histories, so you cannot create pull requests or merge between the branches. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

> [!NOTE]
> Your template repository cannot include files stored using {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}.

{% ifversion fpt %}

> [!NOTE]
> You can use a template repository as starter code for an assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-assignment-from-a-template-repository).

## About repository restoration

A deleted repository can be restored within 90 days, unless the repository was part of a fork network that is not currently empty. A fork network consists of a parent repository, the repository's forks, and forks of the repository's forks. If your repository was part of a fork network, it cannot be restored unless every other repository in the network is deleted or has been detached from the network. For more information about forks, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)."

If you want to restore a repository that was part of a fork network that is not currently empty, you can contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.

{% ifversion fpt %}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only contact {% data variables.contact.github_support %} to restore a repository if you are on a paid {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} plan. For more information about the different plans, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

{% endif %}

It can take up to an hour after a repository is deleted before that repository is available for restoration.

Restoring a repository will not restore release attachments or team permissions. Issues that are restored will not be labeled.

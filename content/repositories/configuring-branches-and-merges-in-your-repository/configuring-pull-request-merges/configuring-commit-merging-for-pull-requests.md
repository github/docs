{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. Under "Pull Requests", select **Allow merge commits**. This allows contributors to merge a pull request with a full history of commits.
{% ifversion default-merge-squash-commit-message %}
1. Optionally, under **Allow merge commits**, select the dropdown menu, then click the format of the commit message presented to contributors when merging.

   The default message includes the pull request number and title. For example, `Merge pull request #123 from patch-1`. You can also choose to use just the pull request title, or the pull request title and description.
{% endif %}

If you select more than one merge method, collaborators can choose which type of merge commit to use when they merge a pull request. {% data reusables.repositories.squash-and-rebase-linear-commit-history %}

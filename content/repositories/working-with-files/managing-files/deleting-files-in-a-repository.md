## About file and directory deletion

You can delete an individual file in your repository or an entire directory, including all the files in the directory.

If you try to delete a file or directory in a repository that you donâ€™t have write permissions to, we'll fork the project to your personal account and help you send a pull request to the original repository after you commit your change. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)."

If the file or directory you deleted contains sensitive data, the data will still be available in the repository's Git history. To completely remove the file from {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you must remove the file from your repository's history. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)."

## Deleting a file

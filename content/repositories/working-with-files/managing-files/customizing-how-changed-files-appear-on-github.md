intro: 'To keep certain files from displaying in diffs by default, or counting toward the repository language, you can mark them with the `linguist-generated` attribute in a *.gitattributes* file.'

Use a _.gitattributes_ file to mark files that match a given "pattern" with the specified attributes. A _.gitattributes_ file uses the same rules for matching as _.gitignore_ files. For more information, see [PATTERN FORMAT](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) in the Git documentation.

1. Unless the _.gitattributes_ file already exists, create a _.gitattributes_ file in the root of the repository.
1. Use the `linguist-generated` attribute to mark or unmark paths that you would like to be ignored for the repository's language statistics and hidden by default in diffs.

   For example, to mark `search/index.json` as a generated file, add this line to _.gitattributes_:

   ```text
   search/index.json linguist-generated=true
   ```

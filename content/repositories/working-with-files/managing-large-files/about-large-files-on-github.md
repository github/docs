## About size limits on {% data variables.product.product_name %}

{% data variables.product.product_name %} tries to provide abundant storage for all Git repositories, although there are hard limits for file {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}and repository sizes{% else %} sizes and recommendations for repository sizes{% endif %}. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}To ensure performance and reliability for our users, we actively monitor signals of overall repository health. Repository health is a function of various interacting factors, including size, commit frequency, contents, and structure.{% endif %}

### File size limits

{% data variables.product.product_name %} limits the size of files allowed in repositories. If you attempt to add or update a file that is larger than {% data variables.large_files.warning_size %}, you will receive a warning from Git. The changes will still successfully push to your repository, but you can consider removing the commit to minimize performance impact. For more information, see "[Removing files from a repository's history](#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history)."

{% note %}

**Note:** If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than {% data variables.large_files.max_github_browser_size %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository)."

{% endnote %}

{% ifversion ghes %}By default, {% endif %}{% data variables.product.product_name %} blocks files larger than {% data variables.large_files.max_github_size %}. {% ifversion ghes %}However, a site administrator can configure a different limit for {% data variables.location.product_location %}.  For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise)."{% endif %}

To track files beyond this limit, you must use {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} ({% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %}). For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)."

If you need to distribute large files within your repository, you can create releases on {% data variables.location.product_location %} instead of tracking the files. For more information, see "[Distributing large binaries](#distributing-large-binaries)."

Git is not designed to handle large SQL files. To share large databases with other developers, we recommend using a file sharing service.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

### Repository size limits

We recommend repositories remain small, ideally less than 1 GB, and less than 5 GB is strongly recommended. Smaller repositories are faster to clone and easier to work with and maintain. If your repository excessively impacts our infrastructure, you might receive an email from {% data variables.contact.github_support %} asking you to take corrective action. We try to be flexible, especially with large projects that have many collaborators, and will work with you to find a resolution whenever possible. You can prevent your repository from impacting our infrastructure by effectively managing your repository's size and overall health. You can find advice and a tool for repository analysis in the [`github/git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) repository.

External dependencies can cause Git repositories to become very large. To avoid filling a repository with external dependencies, we recommend you use a package manager. Popular package managers for common languages include [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), [Node's Package Manager](http://npmjs.org/), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). These package managers support using Git repositories directly, so you don't need pre-packaged sources.

Git is not designed to serve as a backup tool. However, there are many solutions specifically designed for performing backups, such as [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/), [Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com/), and [CrashPlan](https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/).

## Removing files from a repository's history

{% warning %}

**Warning**: These procedures will permanently remove files from the repository on your computer and {% data variables.location.product_location %}. If the file is important, make a local backup copy in a directory outside of the repository.

{% endwarning %}

### Removing a file added in the most recent unpushed commit

If the file was added with your most recent commit, and you have not pushed to {% data variables.location.product_location %}, you can delete the file and amend the commit:

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}
{% data reusables.command_line.switching_directories_procedural %}
1. To remove the file, enter `git rm --cached`:

   ```shell
   $ git rm --cached GIANT_FILE
   # Stage our giant file for removal, but leave it on disk
   ```

1. Commit this change using `--amend -CHEAD`:

   ```shell
   $ git commit --amend -CHEAD
   # Amend the previous commit with your change
   # Simply making a new commit won't work, as you need
   # to remove the file from the unpushed history as well
   ```

1. Push your commits to {% data variables.location.product_location %}:

   ```shell
   $ git push
   # Push our rewritten, smaller commit
   ```

### Removing a file that was added in an earlier commit

If you added a file in an earlier commit, you need to remove it from the repository's history. To remove files from the repository's history, you can use the BFG Repo-Cleaner or the `git filter-repo` command. For more information see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)."

## Distributing large binaries

If you need to distribute large files within your repository, you can create releases on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. Releases allow you to package software, release notes, and links to binary files, for other people to use. For more information, visit "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

We don't limit the total size of the binary files in the release or the bandwidth used to deliver them. However, each individual file must be smaller than {% data variables.large_files.max_lfs_size %}.

{% endif %}

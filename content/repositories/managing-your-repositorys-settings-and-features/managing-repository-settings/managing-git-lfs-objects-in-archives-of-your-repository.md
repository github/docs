## About {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives

{% data variables.product.product_name %} creates [source code archives](/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives) of your repository in the form of ZIP files and tarballs. People can download these archives on the main page of your repository or as release assets. By default, {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects are not included in these archives, only the pointer files to these objects. To improve the usability of archives for your repository, you can choose to include the {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects instead. To be included, the {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects must be covered by tracking rules in a _.gitattributes_ file that has been committed to the repository.

If you choose to include {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} objects in archives of your repository, every download of those archives will count towards bandwidth usage for your account. Each account receives {% data variables.large_files.initial_bandwidth_quota %} per month of bandwidth for free, and you can pay for additional usage. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage)."

If you use an external LFS server (configured in your _.lfsconfig_), those LFS files will not be included in archives of the repository. The archive will only contain files that have been committed to {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

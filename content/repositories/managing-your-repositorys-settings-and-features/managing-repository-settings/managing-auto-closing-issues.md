## About auto-closing issues

By default, merging a linked pull request automatically closes the associated issue. You can override the default behavior by disabling auto-closing.

## Enabling or disabling auto-closing of issues

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. Under **General**, scroll down to the **Issues** section.
1. Select or deselect **Auto-close issues with merged linked pull requests** to enable or disable auto-closing.

## About access management for repositories

For each repository that you administer on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you can see an overview of every team or person with access to the repository. From the overview, you can also invite new teams or people, change each team or person's role for the repository, or remove access to the repository.

This overview can help you audit access to your repository, onboard or off-board contractors or employees, and effectively respond to security incidents.

{% data reusables.organizations.mixed-roles-warning %}

{% ifversion repository-collaborators %}

If you're a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, you can invite a member of your enterprise to collaborate in a repository that either a user or organization owns. The invited user will only have access to the repository, even if the repository belongs to an organization. The user must be provisioned by your company's identity provider (IdP). For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#outside-collaborators-or-repository-collaborators).

{% data reusables.repositories.repository-collaborators-release-phase %}

## About topics

With topics, you can explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem. Topics appear on the main page of a repository. You can click a topic name to {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}see related topics and a list of other repositories classified with that topic{% else %}search for other repositories with that topic{% endif %}.

![Screenshot of the github/docs repository. In the right sidebar, three topics are outlined in dark orange: "docs," "hacktoberfest," and "works-with-codespaces."](/assets/images/help/repository/os-repo-with-topics.png)

To browse the most used topics, go to {% data variables.product.oauth_host_code %}/topics/.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}You can contribute to {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s set of featured topics in the [github/explore](https://github.com/github/explore) repository. {% endif %}

Repository admins can add any topics they'd like to a repository. Helpful topics to classify a repository include the repository's intended purpose, subject area, community, or language.{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} Additionally, {% data variables.product.product_name %} analyzes public repository content and generates suggested topics that repository admins can accept or reject. Private repository content is not analyzed and does not receive topic suggestions.{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt %}Public and private{% elsif ghec or ghes %}Public, private, and internal{% endif %} repositories can have topics, although you will only see private repositories that you have access to in topic search results.

You can search for repositories that are associated with a particular topic. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-by-topic)." You can also search for a list of topics on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-topics)."

When creating a topic:
* Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
* Use 50 characters or less.
* Add no more than 20 topics.

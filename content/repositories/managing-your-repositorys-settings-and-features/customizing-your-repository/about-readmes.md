## About READMEs

{% data reusables.repositories.about-READMEs %}

For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}"[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)" and {% endif %}"[AUTOTITLE](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions)."

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:
* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project

If you put your README file in your repository's hidden `.github`, root, or `docs` directory, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.

If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the `.github` directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the `docs` directory.

When your README is viewed on GitHub, any content beyond 500 KiB will be truncated.

{% data reusables.profile.profile-readme %}

## Auto-generated table of contents for README files

For the rendered view of any Markdown file in a repository, including README files, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will automatically generate a table of contents based on section headings. You can view the table of contents for a README file by clicking the {% octicon "list-unordered" aria-label="Table of Contents" %}  menu icon at the top left of the rendered page.

## Section links in README files and blob pages

{% data reusables.repositories.section-links %}

For more detailed information about section links, see "[Section links](/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#section-links)."

## Relative links and image paths in README files

{% data reusables.repositories.relative-links %}

## Wikis

A README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)."

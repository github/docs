## Linking to the latest release

You can share a link to the latest release for a repository by adding `releases/latest` to the end of a repository's URL. For example, the URL for the latest release of `octo-org/octo-repo` is `https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/latest`.

To link directly to a download of your latest release asset that was manually uploaded, the suffix is `/releases/latest/download/asset-name.zip`.

## Linking to older releases

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.releases %}
1. To copy a unique URL to your clipboard, find the release you want to link to, right click the title, and copy the URL.

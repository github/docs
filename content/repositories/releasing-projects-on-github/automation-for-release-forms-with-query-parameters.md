Query parameters are optional parts of a URL you can customize to share a specific web page view, such as search filter results, an issue template, or the release form page on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. To create your own query parameters, you must match the key and value pair.

You must have the proper permissions for any action to use the equivalent query parameter. For example, you must have permission to create releases to pre-fill the releases form. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)."

If you create an invalid URL using query parameters, or if you donâ€™t have the proper permissions, the URL will return a 404 error page.  

## Supported query parameters

Query parameter | Example

`tag` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?tag=v1.0.1` creates a release based on a tag named "v1.0.1".
`target` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?target=release-1.0.1` creates a release based on the latest commit to the "release-1.0.1" branch.
`title` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?tag=v1.0.1&title=octo-1.0.1` creates a release named "octo-1.0.1" based on a tag named "v1.0.1".

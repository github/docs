{% data reusables.gpg.list-keys-with-note %}
{% data reusables.gpg.copy-gpg-key-id %}
1. Enter `gpg --edit-key GPG key ID`, substituting in the GPG key ID you'd like to use. In the following example, the GPG key ID is `3AA5C34371567BD2`:

   ```shell
   gpg --edit-key 3AA5C34371567BD2
   ```

1. Enter `gpg> adduid` to add the user ID details.

   ```shell
   gpg> adduid
   ```

   $ gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2
   # Prints the GPG key, in ASCII armor format

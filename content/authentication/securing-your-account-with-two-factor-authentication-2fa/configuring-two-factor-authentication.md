{% endif %}

You can configure two-factor authentication (2FA) using a TOTP app on mobile or desktop{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or via text message{% endif %}. After you have configured 2FA using a TOTP app{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or via text message{% endif %}, you can then also add security keys as alternate 2FA methods.

We strongly recommend using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) application to configure 2FA{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, and security keys as backup methods instead of SMS. TOTP applications are more reliable than SMS, especially for locations outside the United States{% endif %}. Many TOTP apps support the secure backup of your authentication codes in the cloud and can be restored if you lose access to your device.

{% ifversion 2fa-check-up-period %}

After you configure 2FA, your account will enter a 28-day check up period. You can leave the check up period by successfully performing 2FA in those 28 days. Otherwise, you will be prompted to perform 2FA in an existing {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} session on the 28th day. If you cannot perform 2FA to pass the checkup, you must use the provided shortcut to reconfigure your 2FA settings and retain access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

If you're a member of an {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_emu_enterprise %}, you cannot configure 2FA for your {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_user %} account unless you're signed in as the setup user. For users other than the setup user, an administrator must configure 2FA on your identity provider (IdP).

{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% warning %}

**Warning:**
* If you're a member{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, billing manager,{% endif %} or outside collaborator to a private repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication, you must leave the organization before you can disable 2FA.
* If you disable 2FA, you will automatically lose access to the organization and any private forks you have of the organization's private repositories. To regain access to the organization and your forks, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.

{% endwarning %}

{% ifversion 2fa-reconfiguration-inline-update %}
{% note %}

**Note:** You can reconfigure your 2FA settings without disabling 2FA entirely, allowing you to keep both your recovery codes and your membership in organizations that require 2FA.

{% endnote %}
{% endif %}

## Configuring two-factor authentication using a TOTP app

A time-based one-time password (TOTP) application automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time. These apps can be downloaded to your phone or desktop. We recommend using cloud-based TOTP apps. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is app-agnostic when it comes to TOTP apps, so you have the freedom to choose any TOTP app you prefer. Just search for `TOTP app` in your browser to find various options. You can also refine your search by adding keywords like `free` or `open source` to match your preferences.

{% tip %}

**Tip**: To configure authentication via TOTP on multiple devices, during setup, scan the QR code using each device at the same time or save the "setup key", which is the TOTP secret. If 2FA is already enabled and you want to add another device, you must re-configure your TOTP app from your security settings.

{% endtip %}

1. Download a TOTP app of your choice to your phone or desktop.
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security %}

{% data reusables.two_fa.save_your_recovery_codes_during_2fa_setup %}
{% data reusables.two_fa.backup_options_during_2fa_enrollment %}

### Manually configuring a TOTP app

{% data reusables.two_fa.manual-totp-app-setup %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Configuring two-factor authentication using text messages

If you're unable to configure a TOTP app, you can also register your phone number to receive SMS messages.

{% data reusables.two_fa.sms-warning %}

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security %}
{% data reusables.two_fa.enable-two-factor-authentication %}
{% data reusables.two_fa.enable-sms-number-method %}
{% data reusables.two_fa.save_your_recovery_codes_during_2fa_setup %}
{% data reusables.two_fa.backup_options_during_2fa_enrollment %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion passkeys %}

## Configuring two-factor authentication using a passkey

{% data reusables.passkeys.about-passkeys %} See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey/about-passkeys)."

{% note %}

**Note:** Platform authenticators like Windows Hello, Face ID, or Touch ID can be registered as a passkey instead.

{% endnote %}

1. You must have already configured 2FA via a TOTP mobile app{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or via SMS{% endif %}.
{% data reusables.passkeys.adding-a-passkey %}

{% endif %}

## Configuring two-factor authentication using a security key

{% ifversion passkeys %}

Not all FIDO authenticators can be used as passkeys, but you can still register those authenticators as security keys. Security keys are also WebAuthn credentials, but unlike passkeys they don't require user validation. Since security keys only need to verify user presence, they only count as a second factor and must be used in conjunction with your password.

{% else %}

On most devices and browsers, you can use a physical security key over USB or NFC. Most browsers can use the fingerprint reader, facial recognition, or password/PIN on your device as a security key as well.

{% endif %}

Registering a security key for your account is available after enabling 2FA with a TOTP application{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or a text message{% endif %}. If you lose your security key, you'll still be able to use your phone's code to sign in.

1. You must have already configured 2FA via a TOTP mobile app{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or via SMS{% endif %}.
1. Ensure that you have a WebAuthn compatible security key inserted into your device.
{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security %}
1. Next to "Security keys", click **Add**.

   ![Screenshot of the "two-factor methods" section of the 2FA settings. A gray button labeled "Add" is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/2fa/add-security-keys-option.png)

1. Under "Security keys", click **Register new security key**.
1. Type a nickname for the security key, then click **Add**.
1. Following your security key's documentation, activate your security key.
1. Confirm that you've downloaded and can access your recovery codes. If you haven't already, or if you'd like to generate another set of codes, download your codes and save them in a safe place. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods#downloading-your-two-factor-authentication-recovery-codes)."

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Configuring two-factor authentication using {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} for 2FA when signing into your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account in a web browser. 2FA with {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} does not rely on TOTP, and instead uses public-key cryptography to secure your account.

Once you have configured a TOTP application, or SMS, you can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} to authenticate. If, in the future, you no longer have access to {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, you will still be able to use security keys or TOTP applications to sign in.

1. You must have already configured 2FA via a TOTP mobile app or via SMS.
1. Install [{% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}](https://github.com/mobile).
1. Sign in to your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account from {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}.
1. Ensure {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} can send push notifications. If you have not opted in to push notifications, you can turn them on within notification settings in {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}.

After signing in and turning on push notifications, you can now use your device for 2FA.
{% endif %}

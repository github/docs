{% warning %}

**Warning:** If you're a member{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}, billing manager,{% endif %} or outside collaborator to a public repository of an organization that requires two-factor authentication and you disable 2FA, you'll be automatically removed from the organization, and you'll lose your access to their repositories. To regain access to the organization, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.

{% endwarning %}

We strongly recommend using two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your account. If you need to disable 2FA, we recommend re-enabling it as soon as possible.

{% ifversion mandatory-2fa-dotcom-contributors %}
If you are part of the group that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} is requiring to enroll in 2FA in 2023, you cannot disable 2FA. A banner will display in your authentication settings to remind you that you are not allowed to disable 2FA. For more information about our 2023 2FA enrollment rollout for contributors to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, see [this blog post](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13).

You can modify your existing 2FA configuration instead of disabling it entirely. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/changing-your-two-factor-authentication-method)."
{% endif %}

If your organization requires two-factor authentication and you're a member, owner, or an outside collaborator on a private repository of your organization, you must first leave your organization before you can disable two-factor authentication.

To remove yourself from your organization:
* As an organization member or owner, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/removing-yourself-from-an-organization)."
* As an outside collaborator, ask an organization owner or repository administrator to remove you from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/viewing-peoples-roles-in-an-organization)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/removing-an-outside-collaborator-from-an-organization-repository)."

For {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the second form of authentication is a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or sent as a text message (SMS){% endif %}. After you enable 2FA, {% data variables.product.product_name %} generates an authentication code any time someone attempts to sign into your account. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they know both your password and have access to the authentication code on your phone.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
You can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} for 2FA after configuring a TOTP mobile app or text messages. {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} uses public-key cryptography to secure your account, allowing you to use any mobile device that you've used to sign in to {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} as your second factor.
{% endif %}

You can also configure additional recovery methods in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials. For more information on setting up 2FA, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods)."

We **strongly** urge you to enable 2FA for the safety of your account, not only on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, but on other websites and apps that support 2FA. You can enable 2FA to access {% data variables.product.product_name %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
If you don't enable 2FA, {% data variables.product.product_name %} may ask for additional verification to confirm that it is you when you sign in for the first time from a new or unrecognized device. See "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/verifying-new-devices-when-signing-in)."

For {% data variables.product.product_name %}, the second form of authentication is a code that's generated by an application on your mobile device{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} or sent as a text message (SMS){% endif %}. After you enable 2FA, {% data variables.product.product_name %} generates an authentication code any time someone attempts to sign into your account on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. The only way someone can sign into your account is if they know both your password and have access to the authentication code on your phone.

You can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} for 2FA after configuring a TOTP mobile app or text messages. {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} uses public-key cryptography to secure your account, allowing you to use any mobile device that you've used to sign in to {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} as your second factor.
{% endif %}

You can also configure additional recovery methods in case you lose access to your two-factor authentication credentials. For more information on setting up 2FA, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods)."

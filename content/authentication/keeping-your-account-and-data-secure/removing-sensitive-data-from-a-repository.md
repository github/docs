## About removing sensitive data from a repository

When altering your repository's history using tools like `git filter-repo` or the BFG Repo-Cleaner, it's crucial to understand the implications, especially regarding open pull requests and sensitive data.

The `git filter-repo` tool and the BFG Repo-Cleaner rewrite your repository's history, which changes the SHAs for existing commits that you alter and any dependent commits. Changed commit SHAs may affect open pull requests in your repository. We recommend merging or closing all open pull requests before removing files from your repository.

You can remove the file from the latest commit with `git rm`. For information on removing a file that was added with the latest commit, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history)."

## About sensitive data exposure

This article tells you how to make commits with sensitive data unreachable from any branches or tags in your repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %}. However, those commits may still be accessible elsewhere:

* In any clones or forks of your repository
* Directly via their SHA-1 hashes in cached views on {% data variables.product.product_name %}
* Through any pull requests that reference them

You cannot remove sensitive data from other users' clones of your repository, but you can permanently remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests on {% data variables.product.product_name %} by contacting {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

> [!IMPORTANT] {% data variables.contact.github_support %} won't remove non-sensitive data, and will only assist in the removal of sensitive data in cases where we determine that the risk can't be mitigated by rotating affected credentials.

{% endif %}

Once you have pushed a commit to {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you should consider any sensitive data in the commit compromised. If you have committed a password, you should change it. If you have committed a key, generate a new one.

If the commit that introduced the sensitive data exists in any forks, it will continue to be accessible there. You will need to coordinate with the owners of the forks, asking them to remove the sensitive data or delete the fork entirely. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}{% data variables.product.company_short %} cannot provide contact information for these owners. {% endif %}

Consider these limitations and challenges in your decision to rewrite your repository's history.

## Purging a file from your repository's history

You can purge a file from your repository's history using either the `git filter-repo` tool or the BFG Repo-Cleaner open source tool.

> [!NOTE] If sensitive data is located in a file that's identified as a binary file, you'll need to remove the file from the history, as you can't modify it to remove or replace the data.

### Using the BFG

The [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) is a tool that's built and maintained by the open source community. It provides a faster, simpler alternative to `git filter-repo` for removing unwanted data.

For example, to remove your file with sensitive data and leave your latest commit untouched, run:

```shell
bfg --delete-files YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA
```

To replace all text listed in `passwords.txt` wherever it can be found in your repository's history, run:

```shell
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt
```

After the sensitive data is removed, you must force push your changes to {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Force pushing rewrites the repository history, which removes sensitive data from the commit history. If you force push, it may overwrite commits that other people have based their work on.

```shell
git push --force
```

See the [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)'s documentation for full usage and download instructions.

### Using git filter-repo

> [!WARNING]  If you run `git filter-repo` after stashing changes, you won't be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands. Before running `git filter-repo`, we recommend unstashing any changes you've made. To unstash the last set of changes you've stashed, run `git stash show -p | git apply -R`. For more information, see [Git Tools - Stashing and Cleaning](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning).

To illustrate how `git filter-repo` works, we'll show you how to remove your file with sensitive data from the history of your repository and add it to `.gitignore` to ensure that it is not accidentally re-committed.

1. Install the latest release of the [git filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) tool. You can install `git-filter-repo` manually or by using a package manager. For example, to install the tool with HomeBrew, use the `brew install` command.

   ```shell
   brew install git-filter-repo
   ```

   For more information, see [_INSTALL.md_](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/main/INSTALL.md) in the `newren/git-filter-repo` repository.

1. If you don't already have a local copy of your repository with sensitive data in its history, [clone the repository](/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local computer.

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
   > Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/YOUR-FILE-PATH/YOUR-REPOSITORY/.git/
   > remote: Counting objects: 1301, done.
   > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (769/769), done.
   > remote: Total 1301 (delta 724), reused 910 (delta 522)
   > Receiving objects: 100% (1301/1301), 164.39 KiB, done.
   > Resolving deltas: 100% (724/724), done.
   ```

1. Navigate into the repository's working directory.

   ```shell
   cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
   ```

1. Run the following command, replacing `PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA` with the **path to the file you want to remove, not just its filename**. These arguments will:
    * Force Git to process, but not check out, the entire history of every branch and tag
    * Remove the specified file, as well as any empty commits generated as a result
    * Remove some configurations, such as the remote URL, stored in the _.git/config_ file. You may want to back up this file in advance for restoration later.
    * **Overwrite your existing tags**

      ```shell
        $ git filter-repo --invert-paths --path PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA
        Parsed 197 commits
        New history written in 0.11 seconds; now repacking/cleaning...
        Repacking your repo and cleaning out old unneeded objects
        Enumerating objects: 210, done.
        Counting objects: 100% (210/210), done.
        Delta compression using up to 12 threads
        Compressing objects: 100% (127/127), done.
        Writing objects: 100% (210/210), done.
        Building bitmaps: 100% (48/48), done.
        Total 210 (delta 98), reused 144 (delta 75), pack-reused 0
        Completely finished after 0.64 seconds.
        ```

      > [!IMPORTANT] If the file with sensitive data used to exist at any other paths (because it was moved or renamed), you must run this command on those paths, as well.

1. Add your file with sensitive data to `.gitignore` to ensure that you don't accidentally commit it again.

   ```shell
   $ echo "YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA" >> .gitignore
   $ git add .gitignore
   $ git commit -m "Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore"
   > [main 051452f] Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore
   >  1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
   ```

1. Double-check that you've removed everything you wanted to from your repository's history, and that all of your branches are checked out.
1. The `git filter-repo` tool will automatically remove your configured remotes. Use the `git remote set-url` command to restore your remotes, replacing `OWNER` and `REPO` with your repository details. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#adding-a-remote-repository)."

   ```shell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
   ```

1. Once you're happy with the state of your repository, and you have set the appropriate remote, force-push your local changes to overwrite your repository on {% data variables.location.product_location %}, as well as all the branches you've pushed up. A force push is required to remove sensitive data from your commit history.

   ```shell
   $ git push origin --force --all
   > Counting objects: 1074, done.
   > Delta compression using 2 threads.
   > Compressing objects: 100% (677/677), done.
   > Writing objects: 100% (1058/1058), 148.85 KiB, done.
   > Total 1058 (delta 590), reused 602 (delta 378)
   > To https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
   >  + 48dc599...051452f main -> main (forced update)
   ```

1. In order to remove the sensitive file from [your tagged releases](/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases), you'll also need to force-push against your Git tags:

   ```shell
   $ git push origin --force --tags
   > Counting objects: 321, done.
   > Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
   > Compressing objects: 100% (166/166), done.
   > Writing objects: 100% (321/321), 331.74 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
   > Total 321 (delta 124), reused 269 (delta 108)
   > To https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
   >  + 48dc599...051452f main -> main (forced update)
   ```

## Fully removing the data from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

After using either the BFG tool or `git filter-repo` to remove the sensitive data and pushing your changes to {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you must take a few more steps to fully remove the data from {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

1. Contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %}, and ask to remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Please provide the name of the repository and/or a link to the commit you need removed.{% ifversion ghes %} For more information about how site administrators can remove unreachable Git objects, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-repo-gc)." For more information about how site administrators can identify reachable commits, see "[Identifying reachable commits](#identifying-reachable-commits)."{% endif %}{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

   > [!IMPORTANT] {% data variables.contact.github_support %} won't remove non-sensitive data, and will only assist in the removal of sensitive data in cases where we determine that the risk can't be mitigated by rotating affected credentials.

   {% endif %}

1. Tell your collaborators to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing), _not_ merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history. One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.

1. If you used `git filter-repo`, you can skip this step.

   If you used the BFG tool, after rewriting, you can clean up references in your local repository to the old history to be dereferenced and garbage collected with the following commands (using Git 1.8.5 or newer):

   ```shell
   $ git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   $ git gc --prune=now
   > Counting objects: 2437, done.
   > Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
   > Compressing objects: 100% (1378/1378), done.
   > Writing objects: 100% (2437/2437), done.
   > Total 2437 (delta 1461), reused 1802 (delta 1048)
   ```

   > [!NOTE] You can also achieve this by pushing your filtered history to a new or empty repository and then making a fresh clone from {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

{% ifversion ghes %}

## Identifying reachable commits

To fully remove unwanted or sensitive data from a repository, the commit that first introduced the data needs to be completely unreferenced in branches, tags, pull requests, and forks. A single reference anywhere will prevent garbage collection from being able to purge the data completely.

You can check for existing references by using the following commands when connected to the appliance via SSH. You'll need the SHA of the commit that originally introduced the sensitive data.

```shell
ghe-repo OWNER/REPOSITORY -c 'git ref-contains COMMIT_SHA_NUMBER'
ghe-repo OWNER/REPOSITORY -c 'cd ../network.git && git ref-contains COMMIT_SHA_NUMBER'
```

If either of those commands return any results, you'll need to remove those references before the commit can be successfully garbage collected. The second command will identify references that exist in forks of the repository (if the repository has no forks, you may skip running it).

* Results beginning with `refs/heads/` or `refs/tags/` indicate branches and tags respectively which still contain references to the offending commit, suggesting that the modified repository was not fully cleaned of the commit, or that it was not force-pushed.
* Results beginning with `refs/pull/` or `refs/__gh__/pull` indicate pull requests that reference the offending commit. These pull requests need to be deleted in order to allow the commit to be garbage collected. A pull request can be deleted in the site admin dashboard at `https://HOSTNAME/stafftools/repositories/OWNER/REPOSITORY/PULL_REQUESTS/<PULL-REQUEST-NUMBER>`, replacing `<PULL-REQUEST-NUMBER>` with the pull request number.

If references are found in any forks, the results will look similar, but will start with `refs/remotes/NWO/`. To identify the fork by name, you can run the following command.

```shell
ghe-nwo NWO
```

The same procedure using the BFG tool or `git filter-repo` can be used to remove the sensitive data from the repository's forks. Alternatively, the forks can be deleted altogether, and if needed, the repository can be re-forked once the cleanup of the root repository is complete.

Once you have removed the commit's references, re-run the commands to double-check.

If there are no results from either of the `ref-contains` commands, you can run garbage collection with the `--prune` flag to remove the unreferenced commits by running the following command.

```shell
ghe-repo-gc -v --prune OWNER/REPOSITORY
```

Once garbage collection has successfully removed the commit, you'll want to browse to the repository's site admin dashboard at `https://HOSTNAME/stafftools/repositories/OWNER/REPOSITORY`, select **Network**, then click **Invalidate Git cache** to remove any cached data.

{% endif %}

## Avoiding accidental commits in the future

Preventing contributors from making accidental commits can help you prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization)."

There are a few simple tricks to avoid committing things you don't want committed:

* Use a visual program like [{% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %}](https://desktop.github.com/) or [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) to commit changes. Visual programs generally make it easier to see exactly which files will be added, deleted, and modified with each commit.
* Avoid the catch-all commands `git add .` and `git commit -a` on the command line—use `git add filename` and `git rm filename` to individually stage files, instead.
* Use `git add --interactive` to individually review and stage changes within each file.
* Use `git diff --cached` to review the changes that you have staged for commit. This is the exact diff that `git commit` will produce as long as you don't use the `-a` flag.
* Enable push protection for your repository to detect and prevent pushes which contain hardcoded secrets from being committed to your codebase. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-push-protection)."

## About signing in with a passkey

You must first add a passkey to your account before you can use the passkey to sign in to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} in the browser. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey/managing-your-passkeys).

Once you have added a passkey to your account, you can use the passkey to sign in safely and securely to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} without having to enter your password, perform two-factor authentication (2FA), or verify a new device. Once you have added a synced passkey on one device, the passkey is available to use across multiple devices. These devices must use the same passkey provider (such as iCloud).

Some authenticators allow passkeys to be used with nearby devices. For example, perhaps you want to sign in to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} using a Bluetooth-enabled laptop that's not set up with a passkey. If you have registered a passkey on your phone, you might opt to scan a QR code, or trigger a push notification to your phone, in order to complete the sign in securely. For more information, see [Signing in with a passkey using a nearby device](#signing-in-with-a-passkey-using-a-nearby-device).

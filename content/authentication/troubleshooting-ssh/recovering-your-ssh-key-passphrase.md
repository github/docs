If you [configured your SSH passphrase with the macOS keychain](/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#saving-your-passphrase-in-the-keychain), you may be able to recover it.

1. In Finder, search for the **Keychain Access** app.
1. In Keychain Access, search for **SSH**.
1. Double click on the entry for your SSH key to open a new dialog box.
1. In the lower-left corner, select **Show password**.
1. You'll be prompted for your administrative password. Type it into the "Keychain Access" dialog box.
1. Your password will be revealed.

If you lose your SSH key passphrase, there's no way to recover it. You'll need to [generate a brand new SSH keypair](/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) or [switch to HTTPS cloning](/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls) so you can use a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} instead.

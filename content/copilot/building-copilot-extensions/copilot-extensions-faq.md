### What is the difference between a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension %} and a {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} chat participant?

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} chat participants use the same backend platform to route requests to extensions. Both provide similar end-user experiences, integrate with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}, and can leverage the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} API or other LLMs.

While they share similarities, below are several key differences:
* {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} chat participants are accessed through different marketplaces.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions %} are server-side extensions, requiring server infrastructure to build. These extensions provide a built-in connection to your {% data variables.product.github %} workspaces, as set by your organization admin.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} chat participants are client-side extensions that have read and write access to your local files. They do not require server infrastructure.
* {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions %} can be used in any editor where extensions are supported, while {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} Chat Participants are only available in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}.

Organization members may encounter cases where an extension cannot access a repository or query context. This typically happens because the organization admin has not yet provided permissions or authorized the extension. See [Granting permissions to access organization resources](/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#granting-permissions-to-access-organization-resources).

### Can a user use a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} that the organization has not provided permissions for?

Yes, any user can install and use a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %}. However, to query organization resources and repositories, the extension must be installed and authorized by an organization admin. See [Granting permissions to access organization resources](/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#granting-permissions-to-access-organization-resources)

Users should contact their organization admin to request installation and authorization. Company context cannot be accessed without admin permissions.

### How do I control which {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} can be used in my enterprise?

Enterprise admins can disable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} across their enterprise by setting the **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %}** policy to "Disabled" or "No Policy".

### Is there an allowlist/blocklist at the enterprise level?

No, there is no allowlist or blocklist at the enterprise level.

### As a member of an organization, how can I get access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %}?

To access {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} as a member of an organization, the organization that assigned you a {% data variables.product.github %} seat must enable the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extensions_short %} policy.

{% data reusables.copilot.copilot-extensions.public-preview-note %}

When you build a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}, you have two options for the visibility of your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}:

* **Public:** Any user or organization account with the link to your app's installation page can install it. Making your app public automatically creates a public installation page, but does not list the app on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
* **Private:** Only the user or organization account that created the app can install it.

If you make your app public, you can choose to publish it on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.

## Changing the visibility of your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org-list %}
1. At the bottom of the sidebar, select **{% octicon "code" aria-hidden="true" %} Developer settings**, then click **{% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}**.
1. In the "{% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}" section, next to the name of your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}, click **Edit**.
1. In the sidebar, click **Advanced**. At the bottom of the "Danger Zone" section, you will see one of two options:
   * **Make public:** If you see the **Make public** option, your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is currently private, and can only be installed by the organization or user that created the app. You can click **Make public** to allow any other account with the link to your app's installation page to install your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}, or leave your settings as they are to keep your app private.
   * **Make private:** If you see the **Make private** option, your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is currently public, and can be installed by any account with the link to your app's installation page. You can click **Make private** to only allow the organization or user that created the app to install it, or leave your settings as they are to keep your app public.
1. Optionally, if your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} is public, you can share the link to the installation page for your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}. In the sidebar, click **Public page** in the sidebar, then copy the link for your listing.

## Listing your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %} on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}

 To list your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %} on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, you must meet the following requirements:

* You must publish your app from an organization that is a verified publisher on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
  * If your organization is not yet verified, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/github-marketplace-overview/applying-for-publisher-verification-for-your-organization).
  * If you need to transfer ownership of your app from your personal account to your organization account, see [AUTOTITLE](/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app).
* Your app must meet the requirements for all {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %} listings on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/requirements-for-listing-an-app#requirements-for-github-copilot-extensions).

App managers cannot create, edit, or publish extensions on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. To manage a listing, you should be an organization owner for the publishing organization.

{% data reusables.organizations.org-list %}
1. At the bottom of the sidebar, select **{% octicon "code" aria-hidden="true" %} Developer settings**, then click **{% data variables.product.prodname_github_apps %}**.
1. Select the app you'd like to publish to the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}.
1. On the app settings landing page, scroll down to the Marketplace section, then click **List in Marketplace**. The Marketplace section is only visible if your app is public.
1. In the "Listing name" text box, type a name for your listing. This name is displayed on the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} page and in search results, and can be changed later. {% data variables.product.github %} recommends using any of the following naming conventions:
      * `YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME` (example: "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}"): We recommend this convention if your extension stays within the scope of a single product and there are no other well-known products with the same name.
      * `YOUR-COMPANY-NAME` (example "{% data variables.product.github %}"): We recommend this convention if your extension spans multiple products.
      * `YOUR-COMPANY-PRODUCT-NAME` (example: "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}"): We recommend this convention if your extension stays within the scope of one product, but there are other well-known products with the same name.

    > [!NOTE] The listing name is not the same as your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}'s name or your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}'s slug. Changing the listing name will not affect the app name or slug.

1. In the "Primary category" section, select the dropdown menu, then click a category. You can change your selection or add a secondary category later.
1. To create a draft listing for your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_extension_short %}, click **Save and add more details**.
1. After you create a new draft listing, you'll see a view where you can manage your listing. Before you can submit your listing for review, you need to:
     * Fill out each of the required sections
     * Verify the organization account that owns the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}
     * Accept the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} Developer Agreement
1. To submit your listing, click **Submit for review**. After your listing is reviewed, an onboarding expert will let you know if your submission was approved or denied.

> [!NOTE] {% data variables.product.github %} reviews all submissions to ensure they meet our standards for quality, performance, reliability, and security. {% data variables.product.github %} may deny submissions at its own discretion, and will provide reasons for denials. You are welcome to address any issues and resubmit your extension for review.

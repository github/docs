## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_windows_terminal %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in the Terminal Chat chat interface allows you to ask questions about the command line. You can ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} to provide either command suggestions or explanations of given commands.

The primary supported language for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is English.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your question and provide you with an answer. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### Input processing

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by Terminal Chat, combined with contextual information (the name of the active shell and the chat history), and sent to a {% data variables.product.company_short %} service that is connected to a large language model that then generates a response based on the context and prompt. User input can take the form of natural language prompts or questions. The system is only intended to respond to command line-related questions. For more information, see [Terminal Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/terminal/terminal-chat).

### Language model analysis

The input prompt is then passed through the language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt to find the command or command explanation most relevant to your query.

### Response generation

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt. This response will take the form of a suggested command or an explanation of the command you asked about. If you want to run a suggested command, you need to click on the command to insert it to your command line. The command does not run automatically. You will need to manually run the command.

### Output formatting

The response generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is formatted and presented to you. Terminal Chat and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} use syntax highlighting, indentation, and other formatting features to add clarity to the generated response.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is intended to provide you with the most relevant answer to your question. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. Users of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system to ensure they are accurate and appropriate.

## Use cases for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in {% data variables.product.prodname_windows_terminal %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in Terminal Chat can help you by providing either command suggestions or explanations of given commands.

### Find the right command to perform a task

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} aims to suggest commands that help you perform the tasks you’re trying to complete. If the result isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can keep revising your question until the returned command meets your expectations. Once you’ve generated the perfect command for your task, you can insert it to your command line to run it wherever you need.

### Explain an unfamiliar command

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} can help explain a command that you asked about by generating a natural language description of the command's functionality and purpose. This can be useful if you want to understand the command's behavior for the specific example provided without having to read or search through the command's documentation. The explanation can include information such as the command's input and output parameters and examples of how it could be used.

By generating explanations, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} may help you to understand the command better, leading to enhanced learning, improved productivity, and less context switching. However, it's important to note that the generated explanations may not always be accurate or complete, so you'll need to review, and occasionally correct, its output. You remain responsible for ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of the commands you run in the command line.

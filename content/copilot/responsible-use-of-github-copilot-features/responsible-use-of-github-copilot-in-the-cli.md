## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} provides a chat-like interface in the terminal that allows you to ask questions about the command line. You can ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} to provide either command suggestions or explanations of given commands.

The only supported language for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} is English.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} parses your question and provides an answer using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### Input processing

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} and sent to a {% data variables.product.company_short %} service that is connected to a large language model that then generates a response based on the context and prompt. User input can take the form of natural language prompts or questions. It may also include choosing the command type they would like to ask about from a predetermined list, i.e. generic shell command, Git (`git`), or {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} (`gh`). The system is only intended to respond to command line-related questions. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).

### Language model analysis

The input prompt is then passed through the language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt to find the command or command explanation most relevant to your query.

### Response generation

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt. This response will take the form of a suggested command or an explanation of the command you asked about. If you want to run a suggested command, you need to copy the command and paste it in a separate window or tab in the terminal.

### Output formatting

The response generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} is formatted and presented to you. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli_short %} uses syntax highlighting, indentation, and other formatting features to add clarity to the generated response.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli_short %} is intended to provide you with the most relevant answer to your question. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. Users of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %} are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system to ensure they are accurate and appropriate. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli_short %} also provides an optional feedback mechanism to rate suggestions, which helps us improve the tool for the future. For more information, see [Improving {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_cli %}](#improving-github-copilot-in-the-cli).

## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} code completion

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completions are autocomplete-style suggestions generated inline by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion creates the experience of working with an AI-powered pair programmer, automatically offering suggestions to complete your code. In addition, it can suggest code comments, tests, and more. It provides these suggestions directly in supported editors while you write your code, and it can work with a broad range of programming languages and frameworks. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot).

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s suggestions may be the completion of the current line, but will sometimes be a whole new block of code. You can accept all or part of a suggestion, dismiss the suggestion, or keep typing and ignore the suggestions.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your surrounding code (relative to your cursor position) and provide you with suggestions. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### Input processing

The surrounding code from the user’s cursor is pre-processed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion system, combined with contextual information (such as code snippets from open tabs in the editor) and sent to a large language model in the form of a prompt. For information about data retention, see the [{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} Trust Center](https://copilot.github.trust.page/faq?s=b9buqrq7o9ssfk3ta50x6).

The large language model then takes the prompt and provides a response based on the prompt. The system is only intended to assist with coding.

### Language model analysis

The large language model that processes the input prompt is a fine-tuned code completion language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of code data specialized for inline code completion.

You can change the model that is used for code completion. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion).

### Response generation

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt and the context provided to it. This response takes the form of generated code and plain text comments, ranging from the completion of the current line to a whole new block of code.

### Output formatting

The response generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is formatted as “ghost text” that is visually distinct from the surrounding code and presented to the user as a suggestion. It is only added to the file/codebase if the user explicitly accepts the suggestion. Users can accept all or part of a suggestion, dismiss the suggestion, or they can keep typing and ignore the suggestions in which case the suggestion is discarded.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} code completion is intended to provide you with the most relevant and useful code suggestions to augment your existing code. However, it may not always provide the answers that you are looking for. Users of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system before they accept them, to ensure they are accurate and appropriate. Additionally, as part of our product development process, we undertake red teaming to understand and improve the safety of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion. The generated code completions are also run through content filters. The content filtering system detects and blocks {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} from outputting any harmful or offensive content, or insecure code. Furthermore, depending on the user’s GitHub settings, the filter also blocks or annotates suggestions that contain matches to public code.

## Use cases for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} code completion

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} code completion can provide coding assistance in a variety of scenarios.

### Generate code based on your instructions

In addition to relying on {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to provide suggestions, you can use code comments to tell {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} about the code you expect to follow the comment. For example, you could use comments such as "use recursion" or "use a singleton pattern" to specify a type of algorithm {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} should suggest. Or you could use comments to tell {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} which methods and properties to add to a class.

### Generating unit test cases

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion can help you write unit test cases by generating code snippets based on the surrounding code typed in the editor. This may help you spend less time on repetitive tasks writing test cases. For example, if you are writing a test case for a specific function, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to suggest possible input parameters and expected output values based on the function's signature and body. Code completion can also suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion can also help generate test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types, helping you ensure your code is robust and resilient. However, it is important to note that generated test cases may not cover all possible scenarios, and manual testing and code review are still necessary to ensure the quality of the code.

This can be a useful tool for programmers, as it can provide guidance and support for common coding tasks and challenges.

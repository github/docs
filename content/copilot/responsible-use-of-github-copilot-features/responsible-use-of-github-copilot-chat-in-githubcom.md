However, features available in these IDEs differ from features available on {% data variables.product.github %}.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} can answer a wide range of coding-related questions on topics including syntax, programming concepts, test cases, debugging, and more. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} is not designed to answer non-coding questions or provide general information on topics outside of coding.

The primary supported language for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom_short %} is English.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your question and provide you with an answer. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### Input processing

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} system, combined with contextual information (for example, the current date and time and the name of the repository the user is currently viewing), and sent to a large language model. User input can take the form of code snippets or plain language.

The large language model will take the prompt, gather additional context (for example repository data stored on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or search results from Bing), and provide a response based on the prompt. The system is only intended to respond to coding-related questions.

### Language model analysis

The pre-processed prompt is then passed through the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt.

### Response generation

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt and the context provided to it. The language model can gather additional context (for example repository data stored on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or search results from Bing), and provide a response based on the prompt. This response can take the form of generated code, code suggestions, or explanations of existing code.

### Output formatting

The response generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is formatted and presented to the user. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may use syntax highlighting, indentation, and other formatting features to add clarity to the generated response. Depending upon the type of question from the user, links to context that the model used when generating a response, such as source code files, issues, Bing search results, or documentation, may also be provided.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is intended to provide you with the most relevant answer to your question. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. Users of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system to ensure they are accurate and appropriate. Additionally, as part of our product development process, we undertake red teaming to understand and improve the safety of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}. Input prompts and output completions are run through content filters. The content filtering system detects and prevents the output on specific categories of content including harmful, offensive, or off-topic content.

## Limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %}

Depending on factors such as your codebase and input data, you may experience different levels of performance when using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}. The following information is designed to help you understand system limitations and key concepts about performance as they apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %}.

### Limited scope

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} has been trained on a large body of code but still has a limited scope and may not be able to handle more complex code structures or obscure programming languages. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}'s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may be more challenging for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to provide assistance with. Additionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can only suggest code based on the context of the code being written, so it may not be able to identify larger design or architectural issues.

### Potential biases

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s training data (drawn from existing code repositories) and context gathered by the large language model (for example, Bing search results) may contain biases and errors that can be perpetuated by the tool. Additionally, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may be biased towards certain programming languages or coding styles, which can lead to suboptimal or incomplete code suggestions.

### Security risks

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} generates code based on the context of the code being written, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly.

### Matches with public code

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is capable of generating new code, which it does in a probabilistic way. While the probability that it may produce code that matches code in the training set is low, a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} suggestion may contain some code snippets that match code in the training set. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} utilizes filters that block matches with public code on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories, but you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities.

### Inaccurate code

One of the limitations of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is that it may generate code that appears to be valid but may not actually be semantically or syntactically correct or may not accurately reflect the intent of the developer. To mitigate the risk of inaccurate code, you should carefully review and test the generated code, particularly when dealing with critical or sensitive applications. You should also ensure that the generated code adheres to best practices and design patterns and fits within the overall architecture and style of the codebase.

### Inaccurate responses to non-coding topics

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is not designed to answer non-coding questions, and therefore its responses may not always be accurate or helpful in these contexts. If a user asks {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} a non-coding question, it may generate an answer that is irrelevant or nonsensical, or it may simply indicate that it is unable to provide a useful response.

### Leveraging a web search to answer a question

Depending on the question you ask, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} can optionally use a Bing search to help answer your question. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will use Bing for queries about recent events, new trends or technologies, highly specific subjects, or when a web search is explicitly requested by the user. Your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} administrator can enable Bing for your whole enterprise, or can delegate this decision to the organizational administrator. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise)."

When leveraging Bing, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will use the content of your prompt, as well as additional available context, to generate a Bing search query on your behalf that is sent to the Bing Search API. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will provide a link to the search results with its response. The search query sent to Bing is governed by [Microsoft's Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

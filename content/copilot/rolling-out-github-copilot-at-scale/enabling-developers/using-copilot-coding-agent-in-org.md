## How {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} can contribute to your organization

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can help your organization address well-defined and scoped issues, such as increasing test coverage, fixing bugs or flaky tests, or updating config files or documentation. For more on the kinds of issues {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} works best on, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/best-practices-for-using-copilot-to-work-on-tasks).

Developers stay in the flow when they ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to create pull requests directly from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} instead of opening issues that may sit in a backlog.

When used effectively, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} offers productivity benefits over traditional AI assistants in IDEs:

* With **AI assistants in IDEs**, coding happens **locally**. Individual developers pair in **synchronous** sessions with the AI assistant. Decisions made during the session are **untracked** and lost to time unless committed. Although the assistant helps write code, the developer still has a lot of **manual steps** to do: create the branch, write commit messages, push the changes, open the PR, write the PR description, get a review, iterate in the IDE, and repeat. These steps take time and effort that may be hard to justify for simple or routine issues.

* With **{% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}**, all coding and iterating happens **on {% data variables.product.github %}** as part of the pull request workflow. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} **automates** branch creation, commit message writing and pushing, PR opening, and PR description writing. Developers let the agent **work in the background** and then steer {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to a final solution using PR reviews. Working on {% data variables.product.github %} adds **transparency**, where every step happens in a commit and is viewable in logs. Working on {% data variables.product.github %} also opens up **collaboration** opportunities for the entire team.

Over time, your engineering teams can benefit from the increased automation, transparency, and collaboration {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} provides. For ideas on how to run a successful pilot, see [Piloting {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}](#piloting-copilot-coding-agent).

For an example scenario that walks through how to use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} alongside other AI features on {% data variables.product.github %}, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/enabling-developers/integrating-agentic-ai).

## Using MCP to enhance {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to provide {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} with access to different data sources and tools.

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} has access to the full {% data variables.product.github %} context of the repository it's working in, including issues and pull requests, using the built-in {% data variables.product.github %} MCP server. By default, it's restricted from accessing external data by authentication barriers and a firewall. You can extend the information available to {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} by giving it access to local MCP servers for the tools your organization uses. For example, you might want to provide access to local MCP servers for some of the following contexts:

* **Web browser**: Set up the Playwright MCP server to allow {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to pull context directly from an external link in an issue.
* **Project planning tools**: Allow {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} direct access to private planning documents that are stored outside {% data variables.product.github %} in tools like Notion or Figma.
* **Augment training data**: Each LLM contains training data up to a specific cut-off date. If you're working with fast moving tools, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may not have access to information on new features. You can fill this knowledge gap by making the tool's MCP server available. For example, adding the Terraform MCP server will give {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} access to the most recently supported Terraform providers.

## Using {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} securely

Security is a fundamental consideration when you enable {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}, as with any other AI agent. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} has a strong base of built-in security protections that you can supplement by following best practice guidance.

### Built-in protections

* **Subject to existing governance**: Organization settings and enterprise policies control availability. Any security policies and practices set up for the organization also apply to {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}.
* **Restricted development environment**: {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} works in a sandbox development environment with internet access controlled by a firewall. It has read-only access to the repository it's assigned to work in.
* **Limited access to branches**: {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can only create and push to branches beginning with `copilot/`. It is subject to any branch protections and required checks for the working repository.
* **Responds only to users with write permissions**: {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will not respond to feedback from users with lower levels of access.
* **Treated as an outside collaborator**: Draft pull requests proposed by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} require approval by a user with write permissions before Actions workflows can run. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} cannot mark its pull requests as "Ready for review" and cannot approve or merge a pull request.
* **Tracked for compliance**: {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s commits are co-authored by the developer who assigned the issue or requested the change to the pull request, allowing attribution of proposed changes. The developer who asked {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to create a pull request cannot approve that pull request. In repositories where an approving review is required, this ensures that at least one independent developer reviews {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s work.

### Security best practices

All AI models are trained to meet a request, even if they don't have all the information needed to provide a good answer, and this can lead them to make mistakes. By following best practices, you can reduce the risks of using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in your organization.

1. Give {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} the information it needs to work successfully in a repository using a `copilot-instructions.md` file. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).
1. Set up the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} development environment for a repository with access to the tools and package repositories approved by the organization using a `copilot-setup-steps.yml` file and local MCP servers. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/customizing-copilot/customizing-the-development-environment-for-copilot-coding-agent) and [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-copilot-coding-agent-with-mcp).
1. Follow best practices for storing secrets securely. See [AUTOTITLE](/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
1. Enable code security features to further lower the risk of leaking secrets and introducing vulnerabilities into the code. See [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization).
1. Configure your branch rulesets to ensure that all pull requests raised by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} are approved by a second user with write permissions (a sub-option of "Require a pull request before merging"). See {% ifversion ghec %}[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-code-governance), {% endif %}[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization) and [AUTOTITLE](/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#require-a-pull-request-before-merging).

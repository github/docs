## About the plans

{% data variables.product.company_short %} offers two {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plans for customers on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}:

* **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_business_short %}** ({% data variables.copilot.cfb_price_per_month %} per user per month): includes most {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} features in IDEs and on the {% data variables.product.github %} website.
* **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %}** ({% data variables.copilot.ce_price_per_month %} per user per month): allows companies to customize {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} for their code and processes, and includes a higher allowance for premium requests.

## About mixed plans

When you subscribe your enterprise account to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %}, you don't need to use this plan across the whole enterprise. Instead, you can choose a plan individually for each organization in your enterprise. This approach allows you to:

* Evaluate the benefits of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} for a smaller group of users before rolling it out further.
* Enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} in the organizations where it will have the most impact, such as organizations with complex documentation or specialized engineering requirements.

## Do we have projects with complex requirements?

For complex projects like monorepos or legacy codebases, developers in your company may need to spend a long time finding and reading documentation before they can contribute.

With {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %}, you can create **knowledge bases** that bring together documentation from one or more repositories in an organization, allowing {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to synthesize information from your documentation in its responses.

## Will we use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %} at scale?

With {% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can provide feedback on pull requests on {% data variables.product.github %}. How much you use this feature depends on the goals of your rollout. For example, if a goal is to increase velocity by accelerating approvals of pull requests, then you may be encouraging developers to use {% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %} as much as possible.

With {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %}, you can make {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s reviews more consistent across your repositories by adding **custom coding guidelines** written in natural language. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will give feedback based on the guidelines when it reviews code, which can increase developers' confidence in the reviews and allow you to encourage consistency in coding standards across teams.

{% data reusables.copilot.code-review.custom-coding-guidelines-prerequisites %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} also includes a higher allowance for premium requests, which include code reviews. To learn more, see [How much will we benefit from premium requests?](#how-much-will-we-benefit-from-premium-requests).

## How much will we benefit from premium requests?

<!-- expires 2025-05-05 -->
{% data reusables.copilot.unlimited-premium-requests %}
<!-- end expires 2025-05-05 -->

{% data reusables.copilot.premium-requests-for-enterprises %}

To decide if you will benefit from a higher allowance for premium requests, compare the goals of your rollout to **development tasks** that each model is specialized in. For example, the o1 model is focused on math and science. Teams who work in specialized areas may require more requests to premium models. To learn about the benefits of different models, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).

Regardless of your plan, you will be able to enable premium requests over the allowance by enabling overage billing. Premium requests over the allowance will be charged at a rate of {% data variables.copilot.additional_premium_requests %} per request, with an additional multiplier applied to certain models.

## Making a decision

To summarize:

* Choose {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} if your company has projects with complex requirements or large amounts of documentation. Knowledge bases give {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} enhanced context, which can save developers time and allow them to focus on tasks they enjoy.
* If you think your developers will benefit from premium models and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code reviews, it may be cost effective to choose {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} rather than pay for premium requests over your allowance.
* If you're not sure about a full rollout, choose {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise_short %} at the enterprise level and enable it for individual organizations where it will have the most impact.

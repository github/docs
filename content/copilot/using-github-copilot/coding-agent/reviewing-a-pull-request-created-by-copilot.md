## Reviewing {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s changes

After {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} has finished working on a coding task, and has requested a pull request review from you, you should review {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s work thoroughly before merging the pull request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have the "Required approvals" rule or branch protection enabled, you won't be able to approve pull requests that you initiated by assigning the related issue to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. Someone else must approve the pull request before it can be merged.

You can ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to make changes using pull request comments, or you can check out {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s branch and make changes yourself.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend you batch your review comments instead of submitting them individually.

When you leave a comment on {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s pull request, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will consider your comment, and decide whether to start a new agent session to respond.

{% data reusables.copilot.coding-agent.write-access-required %}

If {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} starts a new agent session in response to your comment, an eyes emoji (ðŸ‘€) is added as a reaction to the comment, and a "Copilot has started work" event is added to the pull request timeline.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may ignore a comment if it considers that the comment was not intended for it. If you are sure that you want {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to respond to your comment, you can @mention {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} by including `@copilot` in your comment.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't want {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to respond to comments on a pull request, you can unassign {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} from the pull request. If you later reassign {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to the same pull request it will respond to new comments and push more changes. It will not respond to comment that were added while it was not assigned.

For more information, see the section "Use comments to iterate on a pull request" in [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/best-practices-for-using-copilot-to-work-on-tasks#using-comments-to-iterate-on-a-pull-request).

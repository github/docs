   * If you're creating a new pull request, use the "Add a description" field.
   * If you're adding a description to an existing pull request, edit the opening comment.
   * If you're adding a summary as a comment, navigate to the "Add a comment" section at the bottom of the pull request page.

1. In the header of the text field, select {% octicon "copilot" aria-label="Copilot actions" %}, then click **Summary**.

## Overview

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions in {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. You can also use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} on either {% data variables.product.github %} or within a supported IDE. For information on using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} in an IDE, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-ides/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide).

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %} can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-github-mobile/about-github-copilot-chat-in-github-mobile).

In {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to ask:

* General software-related questions, without a particular context. For more information, see [Asking a general question about software development](#asking-a-general-question-about-software-development).
* Questions asked in the context of your project. For more information, see [Asking questions about a specific repository](#asking-exploratory-questions-about-a-repository).
* Questions about a specific file or specified lines of code within a file. For more information, see [Asking questions about specific pieces of code](#asking-questions-about-specific-pieces-of-code).{% ifversion ghec %}

{% endif %}

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}:

* The quality of the results from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.

## Prerequisites

To use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %} you will need the following.

* **Subscription to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}:** You must have an active {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} subscription. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot).

   If you do not have a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} subscription, you can purchase a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_pro_short %} subscription directly in the iOS version of {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, or in the Google Play Store for the Android version of {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}.

* **Access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}:** If you are part of an organization{% ifversion ghec %} or enterprise{% endif %} with a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_for_business %}{% ifversion ghec %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise %}{% endif %} subscription, the organization{% ifversion ghec %} or enterprise{% endif %} owner will need to grant you access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-github-mobile/enabling-github-copilot-chat-for-github-mobile).
* **Enable {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} features for your device:** {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} needs to be enabled from within {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot#enabling-or-disabling-copilot-in-github-mobile). If you cannot see the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} logo in the {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} home page, you may need to update your app version.

## Asking a general question about software development

You can ask a general question about software development{% ifversion ghec %} that is not focused on a particular context, such as a repository{% endif %}.

1. In {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, tap the **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" %}** {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" %}** {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} icon is not shown on every page in {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. If you don't see the icon, navigate to a different page in {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %} and look for the icon there.

1. If the page displays a previous conversation you had with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}, tap {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" %} in the top right corner of the screen, and then tap **New conversation {% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" %}**.
1. At the bottom of the page, in the "Ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}" box, type a question and send the message.

   Some examples of general questions you could ask are:
   * What are the advantages of the Go programming language?
   * What is Agile software development?
   * What is the most popular JavaScript framework?
   * Give me some examples of regular expressions.
   * Write a bash script to output today's date.

1. Within a conversation thread, you can ask follow-up questions. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will answer within the context of the conversation. For example, you could type "tell me more" to get {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to expand on its last comment.

   You can use your initial question as a foundation for follow-up questions. A detailed foundational prompt can help {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} provide more relevant answers to your follow-up questions. For more information, see [Prompting {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} to become your personal AI assistant for accessibility](https://github.blog/2023-10-09-prompting-github-copilot-chat-to-become-your-personal-ai-assistant-for-accessibility/) on the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Blog.

## Asking exploratory questions about a repository

You can ask questions about a specific repository, to get help with understanding the code, or to get help with a specific task you're working on.

1. In {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}, navigate to a repository, and tap the **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" %}** {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.
1. At the bottom of the page, use the "Ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}" box, type a question and send the message.

   For example, if you chose the repository you are working in as the context, you could ask:

   * What is the main purpose of this repo? What problem does it solve or what functionality does it provide?
   * What web frameworks are used in this project?
   * Where is rate limiting implemented in our API?
   * How is the code organized? Explain the project architecture.
   * Are there any specific environment requirements for working on this project?

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s ability to answer natural language questions like these in a repository context is improved when the repository has been indexed for semantic code search. Without indexing, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_mobile_short %} may not be able to provide the most relevant answers to your questions.
   >
   > You can't trigger the creation of a semantic code search index for a repository from {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}. Instead you must use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} in a web browser. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-features-in-your-organization/indexing-repositories-for-copilot-chat).

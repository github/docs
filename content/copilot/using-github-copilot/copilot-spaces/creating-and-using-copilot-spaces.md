## Adding context to {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces_short %}

You can add two types of context to your space:

* **Instructions**: Free text that describes what {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} should focus on within this space. Include its areas of expertise, what kinds of tasks it should help with, and what it should avoid. This helps {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} give more relevant responses based on your intent.

   For example:

   > You are a SQL generator. Your job is to take the sample queries and data schemas defined in the attached files and and generate SQL queries based on the user's goals.

* **References**: You can add any code hosted in {% data variables.product.github %} repositories, including public and private repositories. You can also add free-text content, such as transcripts or notes.

   >[!TIP] You don’t need formal docs to get value from {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces_short %}. Try pasting in a Slack thread, a video call summary, or even bullet-point notes.

This context will be used to provide more relevant answers to your questions. Additionally, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces_short %} will always refer to the latest version of the code on the `main` branch of the repository.

## Using {% data variables.copilot.copilot_spaces_short %}

Once you've added context to your space, you can ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} questions in the chat interface. Your chat will be grounded in the context you've added.

## Overview

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom %} is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions on the {% data variables.product.github %} website.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-github/about-github-copilot-chat-in-githubcom)."

On {% data variables.product.github %}, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to ask:

* General software-related questions, without a particular context. For more information, see "[Asking a general question about software development](#asking-a-general-question-about-software-development)."
* Exploratory questions asked in the context of a specific repository. For more information, see "[Asking exploratory questions about a repository](#asking-exploratory-questions-about-a-repository)."
* Questions asked in the context of a specific repository, file or symbol. For more information, see "[Asking a question about a specific file or symbol](#asking-a-question-about-a-specific-file-or-symbol)." {% ifversion ghec %}
* Questions asked in the context of a knowledge base (that is, Markdown documentation across one or more repositories). For more information, see "[Asking a question about a knowledge base](#asking-a-question-about-a-knowledge-base)."{% endif %}
* Questions about a specific file or specified lines of code within a file. For more information, see "[Asking questions about specific pieces of code](#asking-questions-about-specific-pieces-of-code)."
* Questions about a pull request diff. For more information, see "[Finding out about the changes in a pull request](#asking-questions-about-a-specific-pull-request)."
* Questions about a specific issue. For more information, see "[Asking a question about a specific issue or discussion](#asking-a-question-about-a-specific-issue-or-discussion)."

### Limitations

* Chat responses may be suboptimal if you ask questions about a specific repository that you've selected as a context, and the repository has not been indexed for semantic code search. {% data reusables.copilot.indexing-who-can-do-this %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-features-in-your-organization/indexing-repositories-for-copilot-chat)."
* The quality of the results from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.

## About policies for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}

When you assign a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license to a member of your organization, you can control the features they can use under that license with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} policies.

Policies are grouped into different types.

* **Feature policy:** Defines the availability of a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} feature. Shown on the "Policies" page.
* **Privacy policy:** Defines whether a potentially sensitive action is allowed or not. Show at the end of the "Policies" page.
* **Models policy:** Defines the availability of models beyond the basic models provided with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}, which may incur additional costs. Shown on the "Models" page.

Each policy controls availability for members who receive a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license from your enterprise or organization.

## Organization-level control of policies

Organization owners set policies to control the availability of features and models for users granted a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license by the organization. For example, an organization owner can enable or disable using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in the IDE (unless an enterprise owner has defined availability for the feature at the enterprise level).

The enforcement options for feature and model policies in an organization are:

* **Unconfigured** - A placeholder, which is removed once you have defined a setting. The policy is treated as disabled for this organization until you select an option.
* **Enabled** - The feature is **available** to all members who are assigned {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} by the organization.
* **Disabled** - The feature is **blocked** for all members who are assigned {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} by the organization.

For privacy policies, the options are called "Allowed" and "Blocked" in preference to enabled and disabled. This provides a clearer message of the impact of a privacy policy.

## Enterprise-level control of policies

Enterprise owners can choose to set policies for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} at the enterprise level or to delegate the decision to organization owners using the **No policy** option.

If a policy is defined at the enterprise level, control of the policy is disabled at the organization level.

If organization owners are allowed to set a policy, some organizations may enable a feature while others disable it. If a member receives access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} through multiple organizations with conflicting policies, either the least or most permissive policy may apply, depending on the policy.

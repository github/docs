## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics help key stakeholders and decision-makers understand how their teams are adopting and using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. By tracking usage patterns across the enterprise, you can measure engagement, identify opportunities to increase value, and make data-driven decisions about enablement and rollout.

Metrics are available through:

* The {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics APIs, which provide detailed, exportable data at the enterprise, organization, and user levels.
* The {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics dashboard, which visualizes 28-day usage trends across your enterprise.
* The code generation dashboard, which breaks down how code is being generated by users and agents across your enterprise.
* The {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics NDJSON export, which offers raw data for custom BI tools or long-term storage.

### Organization-level metrics

Organization-level metrics are **only available through the APIs**. Both dashboards provide enterprise-level reporting.

To access organization-level metrics, the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics" policy must be enabled for the enterprise or organization:

* For information on how to enable the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics" policy at the enterprise level, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies#defining-policies-for-your-enterprise).
* For information on how to enable the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics" policy for organizations on a {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} plan that do not belong to an enterprise, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies#enabling-copilot-features-and-models-in-your-organization).

For a complete list of available metrics and data fields, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/reference/copilot-usage-metrics).

## Which usage is included?

The {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics are derived exclusively from telemetry sent by IDEs. In order for an end user to be counted towards these metrics, they **must have telemetry enabled in their IDE**.

This means the data **does not include** activity from other {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} surfaces, such as:

* {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}
* {% data variables.product.prodname_mobile %}
* {% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %}
* {% data variables.copilot.copilot_cli_short %}

License and seat management data are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics reports. To view or manage license assignments, use the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} user management API, which is the source of truth for license and seat information. See [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management).

## Why {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics may differ across API resources

The following API resources expose {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}-related data, but they are not interchangeable and should not be compared directly. Each API resource is designed for a specific use case and data model, and differences in totals or coverage are expected. Use this table to understand which API resource best fits your reporting needs.

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly recommend using the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics API for new integrations and analyses, as it provides the most complete and future-facing view of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage.

| API resource | Scope | Key capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics) | Advanced enterprise- and user-level event telemetry | Provides unified telemetry across completions, chat, and agent modes. Includes usage and lines of code metrics across all IDE modes, languages, and models. Supports detailed breakdowns by feature, IDE, language, model, and user, and is the primary API resource being actively developed and maintained. |
| [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management) | License and seat assignment | Lists assigned {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seats for an organization or enterprise, including license state, user association, and `last_activity_at`. This API resource is the source of truth for license and seat information. |
| [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics) | Enterprise-, organization-, and team-level usage metrics | Provides aggregated usage data for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} features on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} (such as pull request summaries) and some IDE-based completions and chat. Does not include Agent or Edit mode telemetry. Offers enterprise-wide and per-feature breakdowns by IDE and language. Does not include individual-level data. |

## How are metrics attributed across organizations?

> [!NOTE]
> You can grant **organization-only visibility** into {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics without providing enterprise-level access.
>
> You can do this by creating an organization custom role that includes the "View organization {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} metrics" permission, and assigning that role to users who need visibility into metrics for a single organization. See [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-organization-roles).

Organization-level {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics are based on organization membership, not on where individual actions occur. To appear in an enterprise’s metrics, a user must have an active {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seat assigned within that enterprise (in any organization that belongs to the enterprise). As a result, a single user’s usage may appear in multiple organization dashboards, while that same user is counted only once in the enterprise-level total. Organization-level analytics are intended for visibility into adoption and usage within an organization and are not designed to be directly compared to enterprise-level totals.

Organization-level {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} analytics are available starting December 12, 2025. This is the first date for which organization-level reports are provided.

Once a user has a seat in the enterprise, their usage is attributed to **every organization they belong to**, regardless of where the seat is assigned.

This means:

* If licenses are assigned in a dedicated “shell” organization for administrative purposes within the enterprise, users still appear in the metrics for all other organizations in the enterprise they belong to.
* If a user also has a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seat in a **separate organization outside the enterprise**, their activity is still included in the enterprise’s organization-level metrics **as long as they have at least one seat within the enterprise**.

In short: users must be licensed somewhere in the enterprise to appear in its metrics. Once they are, metrics reflect where they work (their organization membership), not which organization provides the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seat or where the activity originated.

## Supported IDEs

To be included in the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics, end users must use one of the following IDEs and {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} extension versions.

| IDE | Minimum IDE version | Minimum {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} extension version |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Eclipse | 4.31 | 0.9.3.202507240902 |
| JetBrains / IntelliJ | 2024.2.6 | 1.5.52-241 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_vs %} | 17.14.13 | 18.0.471.29466 |
| {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode_shortname %} | 1.101 | 0.28.0 |
| Xcode | 13.2.1 | 0.40.0 |

## Data freshness

The data in the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics dashboard and API reports is updated on a regular schedule.

During the preview, you can expect data to be available within **three full days**. This means that data for a given day is processed and made available within three full UTC days after that day closes.

For example, all usage data for a Monday (which closes at midnight UTC) will be visible in the dashboard and API by the end of Thursday UTC. In some cases, such as processing delays over weekends, data may appear up to four calendar days behind the current date.

## What does the data measure?

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics can be grouped into four main categories: Adoption, Engagement, Acceptance Rate, and Lines of Code (LoC) metrics.

**Adoption** measures how many licensed developers are actively using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} within your enterprise. For example, daily active users (DAU) tells you how many unique users interacted with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} on a given day. Ideally, you'll see a consistent upward trend in these metrics during rollout.

**Engagement** measures describe how deeply developers use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} once they’ve adopted it. Key engagement metrics show not only frequency of use but also breadth across features. For example, average chat requests per active user measures how often users open and interact with {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}. You'd want to see regular and increasing chat use across languages and IDEs.

**Acceptance rate** measures how often developers accept {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}’s suggestions. This helps you understand whether suggestions are relevant and trusted. For example, a high inline suggestions acceptance rate indicates that suggestions are relevant and useful.

**Lines of Code (LoC) metrics** measure the number of lines {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggested, added, or deleted in the editor, providing a directional view of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}’s tangible output. For example, "Lines added" shows how much code was actually accepted and inserted into the editor.

## How can I use these metrics?

These metrics can be used together to answer key questions about your teams' usage of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}.

| Question | Use these metrics |
|:--|:--|
| Are my teams using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} regularly? | Daily and weekly active users |
| Which features deliver the most value? | Requests per chat mode, agent adoption |
| Do developers trust {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}’s output? | Acceptance rate trends |
| Are enablement efforts working? | Growth in adoption and engagement after training or communication campaigns |

Look for patterns across these signals rather than focusing on any single number. For example, a steady DAU paired with a rising acceptance rate indicates growing trust and value.

## Overview

The AI Controls view provides a centralized platform where you can manage and monitor agents across your enterprise. From this agent control plane, you can:
* Manage the enterprise-level availability of agents like {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_code-review_short %}, and {% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agents %}
* Control who can manage your enterprise-level {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_short %}
* View a list of agent sessions in your enterprise over the last 24 hours
* Find a detailed record of agentic audit log events

## {% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agents %}

{% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agents %} are specialized versions of {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} that you can configure with tailored prompts, tools, and context, making them excel at specific tasks. {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_caps_short %} can be defined and managed at the enterprise level for greater control and compliance, or at the organization and repository levels to allow teams the flexibility to build for their specific needs.

Before you start configuring agentic settings for your enterprise, you should have a strong understanding of {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_short %}. To learn more, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents).

## Agent sessions

An agent session encompasses an entire interaction with {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %}, or any individual {% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agent_short %}, on a specific task. These tasks include:

* Prompting the agent to create or edit a pull request
* Assigning the agent to an issue

For billing information on agent sessions, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-copilot-premium-requests#usage-by-copilot-coding-agent).

You can manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) server usage in your organization or enterprise by configuring a series of MCP policies on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}. Through these policies, you can allow or block MCP server usage entirely, or restrict access to a list of servers that you define in an MCP registry.

## MCP registries

An MCP registry is a directory of MCP servers that acts like a catalog for IDEs and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. Each registry entry points to a server's manifest, which describes the tools, resources, and prompts that server provides.

After you create your MCP registry, you can make it available to your company, allowing you to:
* Curate a catalog of MCP servers your developers can discover and use without context switching
* Restrict access to unapproved servers for increased security and compliance
* Provide clarity to developers when a server is blocked by policy

## MCP policy settings

The following settings let you control how MCP servers are discovered and accessed in your organization or enterprise:

* **MCP servers in {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}**: Manage the use of MCP servers for all users with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seats in your organization or enterprise.
* **MCP Registry URL**: Specify the URL of your MCP registry, allowing your developers to discover and use approved MCP servers in supported surfaces.
* **Restrict MCP access to registry servers**: Choose whether to allow all MCP servers or restrict access to only those listed in your configured registry.

## Supported surfaces

MCP management features are supported as follows:

## Role

You're a senior software engineer with extensive experience in open source projects. You create appealing, informative, and easy-to-read README files.

## Task

1. Review the entire project workspace and codebase
2. Create a comprehensive README.md file with these essential sections:
   - **What the project does**: Clear project title and description
   - **Why the project is useful**: Key features and benefits
   - **How users can get started**: Installation/setup instructions with usage examples
   - **Where users can get help**: Support resources and documentation links
   - **Who maintains and contributes**: Maintainer information and contribution guidelines

## Guidelines

### Content and Structure

- Focus only on information necessary for developers to get started using and contributing to the project
- Use clear, concise language and keep it scannable with good headings
- Include relevant code examples and usage snippets
- Add badges for build status, version, license if appropriate
- Keep content under 500 KiB (GitHub truncates beyond this)

### Technical Requirements

- Use GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Use relative links (e.g., `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`) instead of absolute URLs for files within the repository
- Ensure all links work when the repository is cloned
- Use proper heading structure to enable GitHub's auto-generated table of contents

### What NOT to include

Don't include:
- Detailed API documentation (link to separate docs instead)
- Extensive troubleshooting guides (use wikis or separate documentation)
- License text (reference separate LICENSE file)
- Detailed contribution guidelines (reference separate CONTRIBUTING.md file)

Analyze the project structure, dependencies, and code to make the README accurate, helpful, and focused on getting users productive quickly.
```

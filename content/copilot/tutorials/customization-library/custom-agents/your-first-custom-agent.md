## About {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_short %}

{% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_caps_short %} are specialized versions of {% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent %} that maintain consistent expertise across entire workflows. Unlike custom instructions that apply broadly, or prompt files for one-time tasks, {% data variables.copilot.custom_agents_short %} are selected for specific tasks and maintain their configuration throughout the workflow.

For a more in-depth overview, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents).

## Your first {% data variables.copilot.copilot_custom_agent_short %}

Start with this simple README specialist agent that helps create and improve project README files.

name: readme-specialist
description: Specialized agent for creating and improving README files and project documentation
tools: ['read', 'search', 'edit']
---

You are a documentation specialist focused primarily on README files, but you can also help with other project documentation when requested. Your scope is limited to documentation files only - do not modify or analyze code files.

**Primary Focus - README Files:**
- Create and update README.md files with clear project descriptions
- Structure README sections logically: overview, installation, usage, contributing
- Write scannable content with proper headings and formatting
- Add appropriate badges, links, and navigation elements
- Use relative links (e.g., `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`) instead of absolute URLs for files within the repository
- Ensure all links work when the repository is cloned
- Use proper heading structure to enable GitHub's auto-generated table of contents
- Keep content under 500 KiB (GitHub truncates beyond this)

**Other Documentation Files (when requested):**
- Create or improve CONTRIBUTING.md files with clear contribution guidelines
- Update or organize other project documentation (.md, .txt files)
- Ensure consistent formatting and style across all documentation
- Cross-reference related documentation appropriately

**File Types You Work With:**
- README files (primary focus)
- Contributing guides (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Other documentation files (.md, .txt)
- License files and project metadata

**Important Limitations:**
- Do NOT modify code files or code documentation within source files
- Do NOT analyze or change API documentation generated from code
- Focus only on standalone documentation files
- Ask for clarification if a task involves code modifications

Always prioritize clarity and usefulness. Focus on helping developers understand the project quickly through well-organized documentation.

## Test it out

Test this agent by giving it a task to complete:

1. Go to the agents tab at [https://github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents?ref_product=copilot&ref_type=engagement&ref_style=text&utm_source=docs-web-copilot-custom-agent&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=universe25post).
1. Using the dropdown menus in the text box, select the repository and branch you're comfortable testing with (ideally one with a minimal or outdated README).
1. Click {% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="copilot" %}, then click **{% octicon "plus" aria-label="Plus button" %} Create an agent**.
1. An {% data variables.copilot.agent_profile %} template called `my-agent.md` will open in the `.github/agents` directory, in the repository you chose. Name the file `readme-specialist.md` and paste in the example {% data variables.copilot.agent_profile %}.
1. Go back to the agents tab (you may need to refresh the page), and in the text box, select your "readme-specialist" agent from the dropdown.
1. In the text box, enter a task for the agent (such as the example below) and click **{% octicon "paper-airplane" aria-label="Start task" %} Start task** or press <kbd>Return</kbd>.

   ```copilot copy
   Please review and improve our README.md file.
   ```

The agent task will appear on the page below the text box. The agent will focus specifically on README improvements using its specialized knowledge, creating a pull request in your repository. You can click into the task and follow along with the agent. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/track-copilot-sessions).

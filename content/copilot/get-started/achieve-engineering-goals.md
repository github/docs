When your company rolls out a new tool such as {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, you will want to measure the impact of the tool on your engineering systems and assess the tool's contribution to your company's goals.

{% data variables.product.company_short %}'s [Engineering System Success Playbook](https://resources.github.com/engineering-system-success-playbook/) (ESSP) provides strategies and metrics for driving meaningful and measurable improvements. The playbook recommends a three-step process for solving engineering challenges:

1. Identify the current barriers to success.
1. Evaluate what needs to be done to achieve your goals.
1. Implement your changes, monitor results, and adjust.

## Define your goals

Based on the recommendations of the ESSP, the following guides show how {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} can help you achieve your company's goals in specific areas. They explain how {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can help, provide advice and resources for an effective rollout, and recommend metrics for assessing {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s impact.

We recommend defining your goals and planning your rollout accordingly. You should communicate your goals to staff and organize training to enable everyone to contribute.

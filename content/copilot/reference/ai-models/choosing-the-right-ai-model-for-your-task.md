## Comparison of AI models for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} supports multiple AI models with different capabilities. The model you choose affects the quality and relevance of responses by {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} code completion. Some models offer lower latency, while others offer fewer hallucinations or better performance on specific tasks. This guide helps you pick the best model based on your task, not just model names.

> [!NOTE] Different models have different premium request multipliers, which can affect how much of your monthly usage allowance is consumed. For details, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

* Work in a non-English programming environment.

### When to use a different model

If you're working on complex refactoring, architectural decisions, or multi-step logic, consider a model from [Deep reasoning and debugging](#task-deep-reasoning-and-debugging). For faster, simpler tasks like repetitive edits or one-off code suggestions, see [Fast help with simple or repetitive tasks](#task-fast-help-with-simple-or-repetitive-tasks).

## Task: Fast help with simple or repetitive tasks

These models are optimized for speed and responsiveness. They’re ideal for quick edits, utility functions, syntax help, and lightweight prototyping. You’ll get fast answers without waiting for unnecessary depth or long reasoning chains.

### Recommended models

| {% data variables.copilot.copilot_gemini_flash %} | Extremely low latency and multimodal support (where available). Great for fast, interactive feedback. |

### When to use these models

Use one of these models if you want to:

* Write or edit small functions or utility code.
* Ask quick syntax or language questions.
* Prototype ideas with minimal setup.
* Get fast feedback on simple prompts or edits.

### When to use a different model

If you’re working on complex refactoring, architectural decisions, or multi-step logic, see [Deep reasoning and debugging](#task-deep-reasoning-and-debugging).
For tasks that need stronger general-purpose reasoning or more structured output, see [General-purpose coding and writing](#task-general-purpose-coding-and-writing).

## Task: Deep reasoning and debugging

These models are designed for tasks that require step-by-step reasoning, complex decision-making, or high-context awareness. They work well when you need structured analysis, thoughtful code generation, or multi-file understanding.

* Weigh trade-offs between libraries, patterns, or workflows.
* Analyze logs, performance data, or system behavior.

### When to use a different model

For fast iteration or lightweight tasks, see [Fast help with simple or repetitive tasks](#task-fast-help-with-simple-or-repetitive-tasks).
For general development workflows or content generation, see [General-purpose coding and writing](#task-general-purpose-coding-and-writing).

## Task: Working with visuals (diagrams, screenshots)

Use these models when you want to ask questions about screenshots, diagrams, UI components, or other visual input. These models support multimodal input and are well suited for front-end work or visual debugging.

| Model | Why it's a good fit |
|-------|---------------------|
| {% data variables.copilot.copilot_gpt_4o %} | Supports image input. Great for interpreting screenshots or debugging UI issues with visual context. |
| {% data variables.copilot.copilot_gemini_flash %} | Fast, multimodal model optimized for real-time interaction. Useful for feedback on diagrams, visual prototypes, and UI layouts. |

### When to use these models

Use one of these models if you want to:

* Ask questions about diagrams, screenshots, or UI components.
* Get feedback on visual drafts or workflows.
* Understand front-end behavior from visual context.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a model in a context that doesn’t support image input (like a code editor), you won’t see visual reasoning benefits. You may be able to use an MCP server to get access to visual input indirectly. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/customizing-copilot/using-model-context-protocol/extending-copilot-chat-with-mcp).

### When to use a different model

If your task involves deep reasoning or large-scale refactoring, consider a model from [Deep reasoning and debugging](#task-deep-reasoning-and-debugging). For text-only tasks or simpler code edits, see [Fast help with simple or repetitive tasks](#task-fast-help-with-simple-or-repetitive-tasks).

## Next steps

Choosing the right model helps you get the most out of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. If you're not sure which model to use, start with a general-purpose option like {% data variables.copilot.copilot_gpt_41 %} or {% data variables.copilot.copilot_gpt_4o %}, then adjust based on your needs.

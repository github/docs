{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} uses the same billing cycle as other license-based products. For details about how billing cycles work across all products, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/billing-cycles).

Within that framework:

* Charges are calculated based on the **number of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seats (licenses) assigned during the billing cycle**.
* You can add or remove seats at any time. At the end of each billing cycle, billed users are calculated based on the number of seats assigned.

For reference information about seat assignment, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/seat-assignment).

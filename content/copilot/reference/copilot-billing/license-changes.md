{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} follows the same billing rules as other license-based products on {% data variables.product.company_short %}.
For the general concepts, see:

* [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/impact-of-plan-changes) – explains how upgrades, downgrades, and seat changes are billed.
* [AUTOTITLE](/billing/concepts/enterprise-billing/usage-based-licenses) – explains how usage-based billing works compared to volume licensing.

This article focuses on how those rules apply specifically to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}, including:

* **What** happens to billing and access when you add, remove, or change seats
* **When** billing changes take effect
* **How** partial billing cycles are handled
* **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}-only scenarios** such as revoking seats, disabling {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} at the organization or enterprise level, or removing organizations from an enterprise

## Personal accounts

What you need to know about the following actions:

* **Upgrading:** If you move from a monthly to a yearly plan, the change is **immediate**. You are charged a prorated amount for the new plan.
* **Downgrading/canceling:**
  * **Monthly plan:** Access remains until the end of the current cycle. **No refund for unused time**.
  * **Yearly plan:** Access remains until the end of the annual term already paid for.
* **Switching plans:** Proration applies when switching between monthly and yearly, and the new plan starts **right away**.

## Organizations

What you need to know about the following actions:

### Adding seats

* **Billing:** Additional {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seats are billed for the remainder of the current billing cycle. Charges are prorated based on the date seats are added.
* **Access:** Users assigned to new seats get access **immediately** after assignment.

### Removing seats

* **Billing:**
  * Billing for that user stops at the end of the cycle.
  * Reduced seat count takes effect at the start of the **next billing cycle**.
  * **No refunds are issued for unused time in the current cycle.**
* **Access:**
  * If a seat is unassigned during a billing cycle, the affected user can still access {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} until the end of the cycle.
  * If a seat is revoked, users lose access **immediately.**

Additionally:

* If **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is disabled at the organization level or licensed users are removed from the organization**: Affected users lose access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} immediately. Billing for affected users stops at the end of the cycle. If a user is restored to the organization or {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is reenabled during the billing cycle, the users regain access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} **immediately**.

## Enterprises

What you need to know about the following actions:

### Adding seats

* **Billing:** Additional seats are billed on a prorated basis for the remainder of the current billing cycle.
* **Access:** Assigned users gain **immediate access** to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}.

### Removing seats

* **Billing:**
  * Billing for that user stops at the end of the cycle.
  * Reduced seat count takes effect at the start of the **next billing cycle.**
  * **No refunds are issued for unused time in the current cycle.**
* **Access:**
  * If a seat is unassigned during a billing cycle, the affected user can still access {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} until the end of the cycle.
  * If a seat is revoked, users lose access **immediately.**

Additionally:

* **If an organization with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} seats is removed from an enterprise**: Billing for those seats will stop at the end of the billing cycle. The users who had seats assigned by the removed organization will lose access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} unless they receive a seat through another organization.

* **If {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is disabled at the enterprise level**: Any user with a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} license will lose access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} immediately. Billing for that user stops at the end of the cycle. If {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is reenabled, users regain access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} immediately.

## In summary

* **Proration:** Applies when adding seats/licenses or upgrading plans. You pay only for the portion of the billing cycle remaining.
* **Access:** Assignments and plan changes are effective immediately for affected users.
* **Removing or canceling:** No refunds are issued for unused time; access continues until the end of the cycle paid for, unless a seat/license is revoked.

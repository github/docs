{% data reusables.copilot.usage-metrics-preview %}

Lines of Code (LoC) metrics provide a directional measure of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}’s output by quantifying the lines it suggested, added, or deleted across completions, chat, and agent features.

## Where LoC metrics appear

You may encounter LoC metrics in:

* **Code generation dashboard (enterprise level)** — visualizes LoC-based user and agent activity. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/view-code-generation).
* **Exports and APIs (enterprise, organization, and user level)** — expose LoC fields such as `loc_suggested_to_add_sum`, `loc_added_sum`, and `loc_deleted_sum`. See [AUTOTITLE](/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics).
* **"Data available in {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics" reference** — lists all dashboard and API fields derived from LoC. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/reference/copilot-usage-metrics/copilot-usage-metrics).

This article covers how LoC is measured and what affects its accuracy and coverage. For detailed definitions, refer to the reference article above.

## Considerations for LoC metrics

LoC metrics may vary across IDEs and versions. Keep the following considerations in mind:

* **Coverage:** Not all IDEs and users will emit LoC telemetry until they upgrade to the required versions. Reports include the `last_known_ide_version` and `last_known_plugin_version` fields so you can monitor coverage across your enterprise.
* **Stability:** As {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} evolves, telemetry definitions may change. Expect small shifts in data as accuracy improves over time.

## Version requirements

LoC metrics require specific minimum versions of IDEs and {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plugins to function. Users on older versions will not contribute LoC data, which may lead to underreporting until they upgrade.

## How agent mode affects LoC metrics

Unlike completions or chat, {% data variables.copilot.copilot_agent_short %} does not follow a “suggest then accept” flow. Agents plan and execute multi-step tasks, often editing multiple files iteratively without explicit acceptance by the user. Because of this, LoC metrics for agent activity are measured differently.

| Behavior | How it’s reflected in LoC metrics |
|:--|:--|
| Agent code suggestions | Counted as `loc_suggested_to_add_sum` when visible code blocks are shown in the chat panel. |
| Agent edits in files | Counted as `loc_added_sum` and `loc_deleted_sum` under the `agent_edit` feature bucket. These edits are not included in suggested metrics. |
| Multi-file operations | Each file edit contributes to total added and deleted lines, even if triggered by one prompt. |

Example output for agent-related LoC activity:

```json
"totals_by_language_feature": [
  {
    "language": "unknown",
    "feature": "chat_panel_agent_mode",
    "code_generation_activity_count": 12,
    "code_acceptance_activity_count": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_add_sum": 86, // code block suggestions in chat panel in agent mode
    "loc_suggested_to_delete_sum": 0,
    "loc_added_sum": 5, // only includes code block copy or apply in chat panel, not agent edits
    "loc_deleted_sum": 0
  },
  {
    "language": "unknown",
    "feature": "agent_edit",
    "code_generation_activity_count": 345,
    "code_acceptance_activity_count": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_add_sum": 0,
    "loc_suggested_to_delete_sum": 0,
    "loc_added_sum": 2342, // agent and edit mode edits in files
    "loc_deleted_sum": 947
  }
]
```

For a single agent edit, you may see metrics such as:

```json
"user_initiated_interaction_count": 0,
"code_generation_activity_count": 1,
"code_acceptance_activity_count": 0
```

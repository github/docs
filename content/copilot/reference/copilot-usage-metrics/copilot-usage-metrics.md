{% data reusables.copilot.usage-metrics-preview %}

The {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics dashboard and APIs display and export data using a consistent set of fields. This reference lists all available metrics and describes how to interpret their values in both dashboard visuals and NDJSON or API exports.

For guidance on how to read and interpret these metrics, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/copilot-metrics).

## Dashboard metrics

These metrics appear directly in the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage dashboard.

| Metric | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Agent adoption | Percentage of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}-licensed active users who tried an agent in the current calendar month. |
| Average chat requests per active user | Average number of chat requests per active user. |
| Code completions (suggested/accepted) | Total number of inline code suggestions shown and accepted. |
| Code completion acceptance rate | Percentage of suggestions accepted by users. |
| Daily active users | Number of unique users who used {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} on a given day. |
| Weekly active users | Number of unique users who used {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} during a seven-day window. |
| Total active users | Licensed users active in the current calendar month. |
| Language usage | Distribution of programming languages used with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. |
| Language usage per day | Daily breakdown of languages used. |
| Model usage | Distribution of AI models used for chat. |
| Model usage per day | Daily breakdown of chat model usage. |
| Model usage per chat mode | Model usage by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} feature (Ask, Edit, Agent). |
| Model usage per language | Distribution of languages broken down by model. |
| Most used chat model | The most frequently used chat model in the current calendar month. |
| Requests per chat mode | Number of chat requests by mode (Ask, Edit, Agent). |

## API and export fields

These fields appear in the exported NDJSON reports and in the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} usage metrics APIs.
They provide granular daily records for each user in the enterprise.

| Field | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `agent_edit` | A dedicated bucket in the API and reports. Captures lines added and deleted directly by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} Agent and Edit mode.<br>These are not included in suggested metrics, since agent edits don’t follow a simple suggestion to acceptance flow. |
| `report_start_day` / `report_end_day` | Start and end dates for the 28-day reporting period. |
| `day` | Calendar day this record represents. |
| `enterprise_id` | Unique ID of the enterprise or organization. |
| `user_id` / `user_login` | Unique identifier and {% data variables.product.github %} username for the user. |
| `user_initiated_interaction_count` | Number of explicit prompts sent to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}.<br><br> Only counts messages or prompts actively sent to the model. Does **not** include opening the chat panel, switching modes (for example, Ask, Edit, or Agent), using keyboard shortcuts to open the inline UI, or making configuration changes. |
| `code_generation_activity_count` | Number of distinct {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} output events generated. <br><br> **Includes:** All generated content, including comments and docstrings. <br> **Multiple blocks:** Each distinct code block from a single user prompt counts as a separate generation. <br> **Note:** This metric is not directly comparable to `user_initiated_interaction_count`, since one prompt can produce multiple generations. |
| `code_acceptance_activity_count` | Number of suggestions or code blocks accepted by users. <br><br> **Counts:** All built-in accept actions, such as “apply to file,” “insert at cursor,” “insert into terminal,” and use of the **Copy** button. <br> **Does not count:** Manual OS clipboard actions (for example, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>). <br> **Granularity:** Each acceptance action increments the count once, regardless of how many code blocks were generated by the initial prompt. |
| `loc_suggested_to_add_sum` | Lines of code {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggested to add (completions, inline chat, chat panel, etc.; **excludes** Agent edits). |
| `loc_suggested_to_delete_sum` | Lines of code {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggested to delete (future support planned). |
| `loc_added_sum` | Lines of code actually added to the editor (accepted completions, applied code blocks, agent/edit mode). |
| `loc_deleted_sum` | Lines of code deleted from the editor (currently from Agent edits). |
| `totals_by_ide` | Breakdown of metrics by IDE used. |
| `totals_by_feature` | Breakdown of metrics by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} feature (e.g., inline chat, chat panel). |
| `totals_by_language_feature` | Breakdown combining language and feature dimensions. |
| `totals_by_model_feature` / `totals_by_language_model` | Model-specific breakdowns for chat activity (not completions). |
| `last_known_ide_version` / `last_known_plugin_version` | The most recent IDE and {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} extension version detected for each user. |

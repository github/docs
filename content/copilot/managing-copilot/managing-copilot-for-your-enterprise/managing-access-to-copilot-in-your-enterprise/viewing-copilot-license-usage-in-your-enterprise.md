1. Under "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} monthly usage," view the breakdown of your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} usage.

   ![Screenshot of enterprise-level billing, showing the section headed '{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} monthly usage.'](/assets/images/help/copilot/enterprise-level-seat-view.png)

   The figures represent the billed seats so far for the current billing cycle. The seat usage so far this month is calculated as the number of seats, divided by the number of days in the current billing cycle, multiplied by the days elapsed so far in the billing cycle. So, if you have 5 seats assigned from the beginning of the billing cycle, and the current cycle is 30 days long, and it's the 10th day of the cycle, this figure will be 1.6666. On day 20, it will be 3.3333 and on the last day of the cycle, it will be 5.

   The total spending for each organization for the current cycle will usually be the number of seats assigned, multiplied by the cost per seat. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot#about-billing-for-github-copilot-business-and-github-copilot-enterprise). However, if the same organization member is assigned a seat in multiple organizations, their seat usage will be included for each organization, but the enterprise will only be charged once. The cost for this person will only be included in the organization where they were first assigned a seat.

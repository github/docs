You can track your monthly usage of premium requests to help you get the most value from your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plan.

## Viewing premium request usage

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_settings %}
1. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **{% octicon "credit-card" aria-hidden="true" %} Billing & Licensing**.
1. Under "Usage by product", on the "Copilot" tab, you can see the total cost of the additional premium requests you've used this month. Click **View details** to view a breakdown of the amount of additional premium requests you've used.

## Optimizing usage of premium requests

You can use the following strategies to maximize the value of your premium requests:

* **Choose the right model for the task**. Some models are better suited to different tasks. If you're using a premium request, you can strategically choose which model you use to get the best result from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).

* **Setting a budget**. Set a budget to track your overages and receive alerts when you reach 75%, 90%, or 100% of your budget. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending#managing-budgets-for-your-personal-account).

* **Monitor your usage regularly**. Check your usage in your {% data variables.product.github %} account settings to see how many premium requests you’ve used. This helps you plan how much you can use for the rest of the month.

* **Upgrade if needed**. If you find yourself consistently hitting your monthly allowance, consider upgrading to a plan with more premium requests included.

* **Avoid retrying large prompts unnecessarily**. Submitting the same long or complex prompt multiple times may use more premium requests. Try rephrasing or simplifying your request when needed.

### About the 30-day trial for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_pro_short %}

Before starting a paid subscription for a personal account, you can set up a one-time {% data reusables.copilot.trial-period %}-day trial to evaluate {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. To begin a trial, you will need to choose a monthly or yearly billing cycle, and provide a payment method. If you do not cancel the trial before the end of the {% data reusables.copilot.trial-period %} days, the trial will automatically convert to a paid subscription.

You can cancel your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} trial at any time during the {% data reusables.copilot.trial-period %} days and you won't be charged. If you cancel before the end of the trial, you will continue to have access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} until the {% data reusables.copilot.trial-period %}-day trial period ends. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/canceling-your-copilot-trial-as-an-individual-user).

## About changes to your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} subscription

{% data reusables.copilot.copilot-one-account %}

You can cancel your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_pro_short %} subscription at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle.

## Determining your billing date

Your billing date will depend on whether or not you are already being billed by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

* **If you are not already being billed by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}**, in most cases your billing cycle will start on the day you sign up for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. For example, if you sign up on 3 September, with monthly billing, your initial billing cycle will run from 3 September until and including 2 October, and then on the same days of subsequent months. For annual billing, if you sign up on 3 September, your initial cycle will end on 2 September the following year.

* **If you already have a billing cycle**, billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will be included in your next bill, or your first bill after the end of your 30-day {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} trial. You will be charged on a pro rata basis for that initial period. If you do not already have an established billing date, you will be billed for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_pro_short %} at the end of your 30-day trial, or when you set up a new paid {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} subscription.

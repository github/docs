## Submitting a question to {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}

You can open {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} from any page on {% data variables.product.github %}. Certain questions may require you to be in a specific context, such as a repository, issue, or pull request. The following procedure describes how to ask a general software related question, and demonstrates the core functionality of {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} on {% data variables.product.github %}. For more information on other scenarios, see [Asking {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} questions in different contexts](/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-github#asking-copilot-chat-questions-in-different-contexts).

Depending on the question you ask, and your enterprise and organization settings, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may respond using information based on the results of a Bing search. By using Bing search, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can answer a broad range of tech-related questions with up-to-date details based on information currently available on the internet. For information on how to enable or disable Bing search integration, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-web-search-for-github-copilot-chat) and [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise).

{% data reusables.copilot.immersive-mode-instructions %}
1. In the prompt box, type a question and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   Some examples of general questions you could ask are:

   * `What are the advantages of the Go programming language?`
   * `What is Agile software development?`
   * `What is the most popular JavaScript framework?`
   * `Give me some examples of regular expressions.`
   * `Write a bash script to output today's date.`

{% data reusables.copilot.stop-response-generation %}
1. If {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} uses a Bing search to answer your question, you can click the **_n_ references** link at the top of the response to see the search results that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} used to answer your question.
1. Within a conversation thread, you can ask follow-up questions. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will answer within the context of the conversation. For example, you could type "tell me more" to get {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to expand on its last comment.

   You can use your initial question as a foundation for follow-up questions. A detailed foundational prompt can help {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} provide more relevant answers to your follow-up questions. For more information, see [Prompting {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat %} to become your personal AI assistant for accessibility](https://github.blog/2023-10-09-prompting-github-copilot-chat-to-become-your-personal-ai-assistant-for-accessibility/) on the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Blog.

1. To start a new conversation, click {% data reusables.copilot.pencil-paper-icon %} at the top left of the page.
1. To see a list of your previous conversations, click {% octicon "sidebar-collapse" aria-label="Open sidebar" %} at the top left of the page.

### Viewing and editing generated files within {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

When you ask a question, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may generate one or more files as part of its response. In the {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} panel, the files are displayed inline, within the chat response. In immersive view (that is, at [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot)), the generated files are displayed in a side panel. You can view and edit the files in the panel, or download them to your computer.

For example, asking `Generate a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript` may generate multiple files, such as `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

In immersive view, you can also preview how some file formats, such as Markdown, render by toggling to the "Preview" tab in the side panel.

### Regenerating a response with a different model

After {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} responds to your question, you can regenerate the same prompt using a different model by clicking the retry icon ({% octicon "sync" aria-label="The re-run icon" %}) below the response. The new response will use your selected model and maintain the full context of the conversation.

You can switch between responses to compare the results from different models.

For help deciding which model to use, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).

### Using subthreads in a conversation

Subthreads are branches of a conversation that are created from a point in a conversation where you asked a question. Subthreads offer more control and flexibility for exploring aspects of a topic, or new topics, all within the same thread.

You can create and navigate through subthreads in {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %}'s immersive view. In the {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} panel, if you open a conversation that contains subthreads, only the most recently edited subthread is displayed.

You can create a subthread in immersive mode by either editing or retrying any of your questions in the conversation.

To edit a question:

1. Hover over the question you want to edit.
1. Click the {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="Edit message" %} button that's displayed.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Edit message' button, highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/subthread-edit-button.png)

1. Edit the question, then click **Send**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only edit the text of a question. You can't edit any attachments.

To retry a question:

1. Hover over the response to a question you want to retry. Resubmitting a question to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may generate a different response.
1. Click the {% octicon "sync" aria-label="Retry" %} button.

   ![Screenshot of the 'Retry' button, highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/subthread-retry-button.png)

The response to your edited or retried question is displayed in a new subthread.

To navigate between subthreads:

* If you have retried a question, a retry counter is displayed under the response, alongside the retry button.

  ![Screenshot of the retry counter, highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/subthread-retry-counter.png)

  Click {% octicon "chevron-left" aria-label="Previous response" %} or {% octicon "chevron-right" aria-label="Next response" %} to navigate to the previous or next subthread.

* If you have edited a question, an edit counter is added below the question.

  ![Screenshot of the edit counter, highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/subthread-edit-counter.png)

  Hover over the counter to display the edit and navigation buttons, then click {% octicon "chevron-left" aria-label="Previous response" %} or {% octicon "chevron-right" aria-label="Next response" %} to navigate to the previous or next subthread.

## Powered by skills

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} has access to a collection of skills to fetch data from {% data variables.product.github %}, which are dynamically selected based on the question you ask. You can tell which skill {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} used by clicking {% octicon "chevron-down" aria-label="the down arrow" %} to expand the status information in the chat window.

![Screenshot of the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} chat panel with the status information expanded and the skill that was used highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/copilot/chat-show-skill.png)

You can explicitly ask {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_dotcom %} to use a particular skill - for example, `Use the Bing skill to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI`.

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}: `What skills are available?`

## Asking {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} questions in different contexts

You can ask {% data variables.copilot.copilot_chat_short %} different types of questions depending on where you are on {% data variables.product.github %}.

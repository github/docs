## Introduction

After you give {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} a task, it works autonomously in the background to complete it. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/concepts/about-copilot-coding-agent).

The [Agents page](https://github.com/copilot/agents) provides an overview of your agent sessions across repositories. From this page, you can kick off new tasks and track {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s progress.

You can also track {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s sessions in a specific repository from {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}.

During or after an agent session, you can inspect the session logs to understand {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s approach to your problem.

## Tracking agent sessions from the Agents page

You can see a list of your running and past agent sessions on the Agents page at [github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents).

You can also reach this page by clicking the **{% octicon "copilot" aria-label="Copilot icon" %}** button next to the search bar on any page on {% data variables.product.github %}, then selecting **Agents** from the sidebar.

For each session listed below the prompt field, you can see its status at a glance, or click on it to navigate to the linked pull request.

To view the session logs, click through to the pull request in the list, then find the "{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} started work..." event in the timeline, and then click **View session**.

You can also start new agent sessions from this page. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request).

## Tracking sessions from {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}

You can see a list of your running and past agent sessions for a specific repository in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} with the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

Once you've installed the extension, you can see {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s sessions by clicking the **{% data variables.product.github %}** button in the sidebar.

For each session listed, you can see its status at a glance, or click on it to navigate to the pull request within {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}.

To view the session logs, click on the pull request in the list, then click **View Session**.

You can also start new agent sessions from {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio-code).

## Using the session logs to understand {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s approach

You can dive into {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s session logs in {% data variables.product.github %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} to understand how it approached your task.

> [!NOTE]
> {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} has its own development environment, including the ability to run automated tests and linters, to validate its changes before it pushes.

## Stopping a {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} session

## Overview

By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s access to the internet is limited by a firewall.

Limiting access to the internet helps to manage data exfiltration risks, where surprising behavior from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}, or malicious instructions given to it, could lead to code or other sensitive information being leaked to remote locations.

The default firewall rules allow access to a number of hosts that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} uses to interact with {% data variables.product.github %} or to download dependencies.

If {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} tries to make a request which is blocked by the firewall, a warning is added to the pull request body (if {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is creating a pull request for the first time) or to a comment (if {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is responding to a pull request comment). The warning shows the blocked address and the command that tried to make the request.

## Allowlisting additional hosts in the agent's firewall

You can allowlist additional addresses in the agent's firewall.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. In the "Code & automation" section of the sidebar, click **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}** then **{% data variables.copilot.copilot_coding_agent_short %}**.
1. Click **Custom allowlist**
1. Add the addresses you want to include in the allow list. You can include:

   * **Domains** (for example, `packages.contoso.corp`). Traffic will be allowed to the specified domain and any subdomains.

     **Example**: `packages.contoso.corp` will allow traffic to `packages.contoso.corp` and `prod.packages.contoso.corp`, but not `artifacts.contoso.corp`.

   * **URLs** (for example, `https://packages.contoso.corp/project-1/`). Traffic will only be allowed on the specified scheme (`https`) and host (`packages.contoso.corp`), and limited to the specified path and descendant paths.

     **Example**: `https://packages.contoso.corp/project-1/` will allow traffic to `https://packages.contoso.corp/project-1/` and `https://packages.contoso.corp/project-1/tags/latest`, but not `https://packages.consoto.corp/project-2`, `ftp://packages.contoso.corp` or `https://artifacts.contoso.corp`.

1. Click **Add Rule**.
1. After validating your list, click **Save changes**.

## Overwriting the recommended firewall allowlist

By default, the firewall allows access to a number of hosts that are commonly used to download dependencies or that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} uses to interact with {% data variables.product.github %}.

To disable this, toggle the **Recommended allowlist** setting **off**.

To use the recommended allowlist in addition to your own allowlist, keep the **Recommended allowlist** setting **on**, and add your additional addresses in the **Custom allowlist** page.

### Disabling the firewall

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling the firewall will allow {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} to connect to any host, increasing risks of exfiltration of code or other sensitive information.

The firewall is enabled by default. To disable the firewall, toggle the **Enable firewall** setting to **off**.

You can track your monthly usage of premium requests to help you get the most value from your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plan.

> [!NOTE]
> Premium request counters reset on the 1st of each month at 00:00:00 UTC.

## Viewing premium request usage

There are multiple ways to view your premium request usage:

* [View current usage directly within your IDE](#viewing-usage-in-your-ide)
* [Viewing an overview in your Billing and licensing settings](#viewing-an-overview-in-your-billing-and-licensing-settings)
* [View detailed analytics of your usage](#viewing-detailed-analytics-of-your-usage)
* [Download a usage report for your personal account](#downloading-a-usage-report-for-your-personal-account)

If you reach your limit for premium requests, you will be notified with a message in each of the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} interfaces you use.

For information about viewing premium request usage for an organization or enterprise, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use).

### Viewing usage in your IDE

If you're using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} in an editor, you can view your usage directly in the editor. For example, in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}, you can view information about features included in your plan, your progress towards any limits on your plan, and the date your allowance resets.

![Screenshot of the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} current usage window in {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %}. The "Code completions" and "Chat messages" bars indicate they are included with the user's {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} plan. The "Premium requests" bar indicates the user has used 99.5% of their allowance, and that it will reset on June 30, 2025.](/assets/images/help/copilot/vscode-current-usage.png)

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_billing_settings_url %} The "Overview" page shows a summary of your current {% data variables.product.github %} usage.
1. Scroll down to the "Metered usage" area and click {% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="copilot" %} **{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}** to show only your {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} use.

### Viewing detailed analytics of your usage

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_billing_settings_url %}
1. In the side bar, click **Premium request analytics** to show detailed analytics.
1. Use the filter, "Group by", and "Timeframe" options to change the data displayed in the chart and table.
   {% data reusables.billing.premium-request-analytics-start %}

### Downloading a usage report for your personal account

Reports include all premium request usage, both within and beyond your allowance.

{% data reusables.user-settings.access_billing_settings_url %}
1. In the side bar, click **Premium request analytics** to show detailed analytics.
1. At the top of the page, click **Get usage report** to generate a CSV report of your premium request use for the past 45 days.

When the report is ready for you to download, you'll receive a message to your primary email account with a link to download the report. The link will expire after 24 hours. For details of the fields included in the reports, see [AUTOTITLE](/billing/reference/billing-reports#premium-request-analytics-usage-report-fields).

## Optimizing usage of premium requests

You can use the following strategies to maximize the value of your premium requests:

* **Choose the right model for the task**. Some models are better suited to different tasks. If you're using a premium request, you can strategically choose which model you use to get the best result from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison).

* **Setting a budget**. Set a budget to track your overages and receive alerts when you reach 75%, 90%, or 100% of your budget. See [AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending#managing-budgets-for-your-personal-account).

* **Monitor your usage regularly**. Check your usage in your {% data variables.product.github %} account settings to see how many premium requests youâ€™ve used. This helps you plan how much you can use for the rest of the month.

* **Upgrade if needed**. If you find yourself consistently hitting your monthly allowance, consider upgrading to a plan with more premium requests included.

* **Avoid retrying large prompts unnecessarily**. Submitting the same long or complex prompt multiple times may use more premium requests. Try rephrasing or simplifying your request when needed.

* **Define whether users can use premium requests over their included allowance** (enterprises and organizations only). Set a policy to control whether users can incur extra costs for premium requests when they use up their included allowance. See [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/manage-request-allowances).

## Managing premium request billing with multiple {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licenses

If you have {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licenses from multiple standalone organizations or enterprises, you must define which entity is charged for your use of premium requests. Until you define a billing entity, all premium requests you make will be rejected.

In the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} feature settings for your personal account, a **Usage billed to** dropdown is displayed in the "Billing" section if you are assigned {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} licenses by two or more enterprises or standalone organizations.

![Screenshot of the {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} feature settings. The "Usage billed to" dropdown is open.](/assets/images/help/billing/copilot-billing-entity-dropdown.png)

You can change your billing entity selection at any time. All subsequent premium requests are billed to the newly selected entity.

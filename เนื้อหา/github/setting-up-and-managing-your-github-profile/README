## About your profile README

You can share information about yourself with the community on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} by creating a profile README. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.

You decide what information to include in your profile README, so you have full control over how you present yourself on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. Here are some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or useful in your profile README.

- An "About me" section that describes your work and interests
- Contributions you're proud of, and context about those contributions
- Guidance for getting help in communities where you're involved

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your profile README by using {% data variables.product.company_short %} Flavored Markdown. For more information, see "[Getting started with writing and formatting on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)."

## Prerequisites

GitHub will display your profile README on your profile page if all of the following are true.

- You've created a repository with a name that matches your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} username.
- The repository is public.
- The repository contains a file named README.md in its root.
- The README.md file contains any content.

{% note %}

**Note**: If you created a public repository with the same name as your username before July 2020, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} won't automatically show the repository's README on your profile. You can manually share the repository's README to your profile by going to the repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} and clicking **Share to profile**.

## Removing a profile README

The profile README is removed from your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} profile if any of the following apply:

- The README file is empty or doesn't exist.
- The repository is private.
- The repository name no longer matches your username.

The method you choose depends upon your needs, but if you're unsure, we recommend making your repository private.

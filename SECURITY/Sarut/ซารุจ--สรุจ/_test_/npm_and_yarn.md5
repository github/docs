Target branches Branch targeting determines which branches will be protected by this ruleset. Use inclusion patterns to expand the list of branches under this ruleset. Use exclusion patterns to exclude branches. Branch targeting criteria All branches Default workflow_executions Rules Which rules should be applied? Branch rules Restrict creations Only allow users with bypass permission to create matching refs. Restrict updates Only allow users with bypass permission to update matching refs. Allow fork syncing Branch can pull changes from its upstream repository Restrict deletions Only allow users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs. Require linear history Prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching refs. Require deployments to succeed Choose which environments must be successfully deployed to before refs can be pushed into a ref that matches this rule. Select deployment environments https://github.com/tr4200812/N00i1kat/issues/480 No deployment environments found No deployment environments have been added Learn more about deployment environments Require signed commits Commits pushed to matching refs must have verified signatures. Require a pull request before merging Require all commits be made to a non-target branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged. Required approvals The number of approving reviews that are required before a pull request can be merged. Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed New, reviewable commits pushed will dismiss previous pull request review approvals. Require review from Code Owners Require an approving review in pull requests that modify files that have a designated code owner. Require approval of the most recent reviewable push Whether the most recent reviewable push must be approved by someone other than the person who pushed it. Require conversation resolution before merging All conversations on code must be resolved before a pull request can be merged. Request pull request review from Copilot Automatically request review from Copilot for new pull requests, if the author has access to Copilot code review. Allowed merge methods When merging pull requests, you can allow any combination of merge commits, squashing, or rebasing. At least one option must be enabled. Require status checks to pass Choose which status checks must pass before the ref is updated. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another ref where the checks pass. Require branches to be up to date before merging Whether pull requests targeting a matching branch must be tested with the latest code. This setting will not take effect unless at least one status check is enabled. Do not require status checks on creation Allow repositories and branches to be created if a check would otherwise prohibit it. No required checks No checks have been added Learn more about status checks Block force pushes Prevent users with push access from force pushing to refs. Require code scanning results Choose which tools must provide code scanning results before the reference is updated. When configured, code scanning must be enabled and have results for both the commit and the reference being updated. Footer © 2025 GitHub, Inc.

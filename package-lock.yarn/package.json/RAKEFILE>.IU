Investor BulletIn
How to read A Mutual Fund shareholder report
The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is issuing this Investor Bulletin to educate individual investors about
mutual fund shareholder reports.
Annual and Semiannual Reports
Mutual funds that are registered with the seC must send reports to their shareholders on a semiannual basis. the
semiannual report covers the first six months of the fund’s fiscal year, while the annual report covers the fund’s entire fiscal
year. Mutual funds that are registered with the seC prepare their own shareholder reports and file them with the seC.
so long as these funds disclose the information that the seC requires in the shareholder report, they can decide how to
organize and present the information within the report.
this investor bulletin focuses primarily on the annual report; however, many of the considerations also apply to the
semiannual report. think of these shareholder reports as a “report card” on the fund’s progress. Reading these reports can
help you determine how well a fund has met its goals and investment strategies during the period covered in the report.
What Information Can I Find in a Shareholder Report?
the table below identifies select information required to be disclosed in: (1) both the annual and semiannual report;
and (2) the annual report only.

Investors generally read the shareholder report to determine how well a fund has met its goals and investment
strategies during the past six-month period (semiannual report) or the past fiscal year (annual report). Following are
descriptions of several items in a shareholder report. the order of the items listed may vary from one report to another.
Performance Information
As shown in the table above, the performance information typically consists of three components: (1) management’s
discussion of fund performance; (2) a line graph comparing the performance during the last 10 years (or for the life of the
fund, if shorter) of a hypothetical $10,000 initial investment against an index; and (3) a table showing the fund’s
returns for 1-, 5-, and 10-year (or for the life of the fund, if shorter) periods.
Management’s Discussion of Fund Performance. You will find fund management’s discussion near the
front of the annual report. this is management’s opportunity to discuss the fund’s performance during the
fiscal year in light of market conditions and other factors that may have influenced the fund’s investment return
for the year. In that discussion, management usually will point out which holdings of the fund contributed
significantly to the fund’s performance and which holdings detracted significantly from that performance.
Line graph. Also near the front of the annual report is a line graph comparing the performance during the
last 10 years (or for the life of the fund, if shorter) of a hypothetical $10,000 initial investment in the fund
against an index. the line graph will be some variation of the generic line graph pictured below:
Investor Assistance (800) 732-0330 www.investor.gov
3
the graph will show the progress of at least two lines over a ten-year period. one line will represent the
growth or decline in value of a hypothetical $10,000 initial investment in the fund during the last 10
years (or for the life of the fund, if shorter). Another line will represent the performance of an appropriate
broad-based securities market index (for example, the s&P 500 index) during the last 10 years (showing the
growth or decline in value of the hypothetical $10,000 had it been invested in a fund corresponding to that
index). there may be additional lines representing other indexes, including those more narrowly-based that
reflect the market sectors in which the fund invests or a non-securities index such as the Consumer Price
Index, so long as the comparison is not misleading.
A quick glance at the graph will tell you whether the fund’s performance has been steady or volatile over
the 10-year period (or over the life of the fund, if shorter). For example, if the slope of the line is gradual,
with occasional ups and downs, it suggests that fund performance has been relatively stable. If, on the other
hand, the slope of the line is choppy, with numerous peaks and valleys, it suggests that the fund has been
volatile and has experienced frequent variations in performance. Compare the slope of that line with the line
representing the index to which the fund is being compared. How closely does the fund’s performance track
that of the index?
Investor Assistance (800) 732-0330 www.investor.gov

n Performance Table. underneath the line graph is a table showing the fund’s annualized (or average annual)
returns for 1-, 5-, and 10-year (or for the life of the fund, if shorter) periods. Below is an example of this type
of table:
Average Annual Total Returns
Periods Ended December 31, 20XX
one Year Five Years ten Years Final value of a $10,000 investment
XYZ Fund 1.08% 0.31% 3.84% $14,575
Benchmark/Index 1.08 0.29 3.87 14,616
Pay close attention to the fund’s 5- and 10-year returns. If the fund’s returns were stellar in the past year but
unimpressive in the past five or 10 years (or over the life of the fund, if shorter), it is possible that the past year’s
outperformance will not last. on the other hand, if the fund experienced steady returns in the past five or 10
years, but suffered a sharp loss in the past year, it may be unclear as to whether the recent loss signals the
beginning of a trend or is an isolated occurrence. Just because a fund had one good year does not mean that
positive investment returns will continue. Remember, past performance is not necessarily an indication of
future results.
Expense Example
the expense example is calculated using a fund’s expense ratio for the preceding six months but does not include the
impact of sales loads, if any. the expense example consists of two different tables. the first table shows the actual cost
in dollars for a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the fund over a six-month period. Below is an example of this
type of table:
Six Months Ended January 31, 2013
XYZ Fund
Based on Actual Beginning Account value ending Account value expenses Paid
Fund Return 7/31/2012 1/31/2013 During Period
ABC shares $1,000 $1,031.75 $1.23
DeF shares 1,000 1,032.25 0.51
Institutional shares 1,000 1,032.55 0.41
According to the example above, if you owned class ABC shares in the hypothetical XYZ Fund, you would have paid
$1.23 in expenses for every $1,000 that you owned in the fund during the six-month period identified at the top of the
table. to find out how much your expense was during that six-month period, round the value of the shares you own to
the nearest multiple of $1,000 and multiply by the expense amount.
For example, if you had approximately $25,000 invested in the ABC share class of the hypothetical XYZ Fund, your
expenses would have been: 25 x $1.23 = $30.75 over the six-month period.
Investor Assistance (800) 732-0330 www.investor.gov
5
the second table in the expense example shows the cost in dollars for a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the fund over
the six-month period based on a hypothetical 5% yearly return and not the actual return of the fund during that
period. Below is an example of this type of table:
Six Months Ended January 31, 2013
XYZ Fund
Based on Hypothetical Beginning Account value ending Account value expenses Paid
5% Yearly Return 7/31/2012 1/31/2013 During Period
ABC shares $1,000 $1,024.00 $1.22
DeF shares 1,000 1,024.70 0.51
Institutional shares 1,000 1,024.80 0.41
Because funds are required to use the same hypothetical performance in calculating their expenses for the period
covered by the shareholder report, this second table makes it possible for you to compare the expenses of this fund with
that of other funds. For example, the table above shows that the expenses paid during the six-month period for class
ABC shares—assuming a 5% annual return—would have been $1.22 per $1,000 invested. You can compare that
expense with that of a completely different fund to determine which fund has higher operating expenses. If, for example,
that other fund showed an expense ratio of $1.55 per $1,000 invested in a similar share class, that other fund generally
would be considered more expensive than the XYZ Fund (as stated above, these examples do not include sales loads).
Financial Statements
the annual report contains audited financial statements, including a complete or summary (top 50) list of portfolio
holdings. this is where you can learn, among other things, what assets the fund holds (or at least the 50 largest individual
holdings), the number of shares owned of each asset, and their market value. regardless of whether the financial
statements include the complete list or a summary of portfolio holdings, you can find the full list in the fund’s seC
filings, which are publicly available through the seC’s eDGAr database (www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/mutualsearch.htm). Also, if the fund posts its complete list of portfolio holdings online, you may be able to locate that list
on the fund’s website identified in its annual report.
As you review the portfolio holdings, consider the following questions:
n Are the fund’s holdings, as reflected in the financial statements, consistent with the fund’s investment objectives
and strategy as stated in the fund’s prospectus?
Are the fund’s holdings consistent with your expectations, based on the fund’s name, investment objectives,
strategy, and principal risks as disclosed in the fund’s prospectus?
n 
Investor Assistance (800) 732-0330 www.investor.gov
6
n Do you detect any “style drift,” meaning the fund has strayed from its stated investment objectives (for example,
an international stock fund that is unusually concentrated in domestic stocks, or a specific country fund that holds
a lot of assets in a country other than the one identified in the name of the fund)?
Do the fund’s holdings overlap or mirror those of other funds that you own? If so, your investments may not be
sufficiently diversified. unless you intend to concentrate your investments in a few stocks or bonds or industry
sectors, consider adjusting your asset allocation to achieve a more diversified portfolio.
n
Graphical Representation of Holdings
the shareholder report contains a table, chart, or graph of the fund’s holdings by category (for example, type of security,
industry sector, geographic region, credit quality, or maturity). Below is a hypothetical example of what a table showing
a fund’s holdings categorized by industry sector might look like:
Portfolio Allocation as of ___, 20XX
Percentage of Net Assets
Consumer Discretionary 12.0%
Consumer Staples 9.9
Energy 10.0
Financials 15.4
Health Care 12.0
Industrials 11.0
Information Technology 19.2
Materials 3.9
Telecommunication Services 2.9
Utilities 3.7
Condensed Financial Information/Financial Highlights
the condensed financial information or financial highlights section includes a summary table of financial information
covering the past five years (or since the fund’s inception, if less than five years). the summary table contains a breakdown
of the change in the fund’s net asset value (nAv) from one year to another over the five-year period.
n look at the line item showing the fund’s total return over the past five years. What does the total return tell
you about the fund’s performance trend during the last five years? Have the fund’s returns been relatively steady
from year to year or have they been volatile?
look at the line item showing the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. the portfolio turnover rate reveals the frequency
with which the fund turns over its portfolio by buying and selling securities. the fund pays transaction costs,
such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
n 
Investor Assistance (800) 732-0330 www.investor.gov
7
rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable
account. these costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the expense example,
affect the fund’s performance. the portfolio turnover rate will vary depending on the fund’s investment
strategy. An actively-managed fund may have a high portfolio turnover rate because of its rapid trading style,
while a broad-based index fund will tend to have a low portfolio turnover rate due to its passive investment
style. Keep in mind that a higher turnover rate may generate higher commissions and other trading costs that
can cut into a fund’s performance; it may also trigger capital gains taxes which the fund will pass on to you.
the issue of return of capital distributions comes up occasionally with respect to open end funds, and the
financial highlights section of the shareholder report provides information about the fund’s distributions to
shareholders. Distributions to shareholders may come from net investment income, net realized gains, or return
of capital. If a fund does not earn enough income and realized gains to cover its distributions to shareholders in a
given year, the fund may return capital to its shareholders. Investors should not mistake any return of capital for
yield or total return on their investment in the fund. shareholders who periodically receive a dividend payment
or other distribution consisting of a return of capital may think that they are receiving net profits when, in fact,
that is not the case. under this circumstance, you should not assume that the source of a distribution from the
fund is net profit.
skim the Notes to Financial Statements. these notes can contain useful information about the fund, such
as whether there are any pending lawsuits or other contingencies that could affect the fund’s performance or
the operation of the fund.
n
n
Additional Items
the annual report contains additional items, some of which are summarized here. For example, you can find
management compensation information in a number of places in the annual report. Funds typically disclose management
compensation information in the Notes to Financial Statements, usually in two different locations within the annual
report. Management compensation paid to the adviser usually is disclosed in a note that discusses the advisory fee rate
and/or fees paid to affiliates. the amount paid to directors is generally reported in a separate note in the Notes to
Financial Statements. the annual report also contains information about the fund’s directors and officers, including
their names, ages, length of time at the fund, their principal occupations over the past five years, and their responsibilities.
In addition, either the annual or semiannual report will contain a statement regarding the basis for board approval of
the investment advisory contract (discussing the reasons the board approved any investment advisory contract during
the period covered by the report), as well as proxy-related information.
on rare occasions, annual and semiannual reports will contain information regarding changes in and disagreements
with accountants (if applicable). Annual and semiannual reports also include statements regarding the availability of
the quarterly portfolio schedule, proxy voting policies and procedures, and the fund’s proxy voting record.

+IMPORTANT INFORMATION
+You may obtain a Medallion Guarantee from a

+account. We ask for a guarantee of your
+signature instead of a notarization because a
+notary does not provide the legal protection
+needed to process your transaction. Medallion

+$50,000 or more, (2) you request a check
+distribution to be sent to an address other than
+the address of record, (3) you request a check
+distribution to be sent to your address of record,
+and your address of record has been changed in
+the last 15 days, (4) you request an ACH or wire
+distribution for bank information not on the
+account.
+Under penalty of perjury, I certify that (1) the Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number shown on this form is my correct Taxpayer
+Identification Number, and (2) I am not subject to backup withholding either because I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I
+am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest and dividends, or the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup
+withholding. The IRS does not require your consent to any provision of the document other than the certifications required to avoid backup withholding. If I
+am affiliated with or work for a FINRA member firm, I will attach information concerning my employment. This application shall apply to any J.P. Morgan
+Funds account I establish at any later date unless specifically changed in writing. Cross off line (2) if you are subject to backup withholding.
+The participant hereby authorizes this distribution(s) from the SIMPLE IRA to the undersigned and certifies that it is in accordance with the provisions of the
+SIMPLE IRA plan. I indemnify the custodian of J.P. Morgan Funds SIMPLE IRA, its agents, successors and affiliates from any and all claims the undersigned

+Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless
+otherwise noted.
+Future Developments
+For the latest information about Form 4506-T and its
+instructions, go to www.irs.gov/form4506t. Information about
+any recent developments affecting Form 4506-T (such as
+legislation enacted after we released it) will be posted on that
+page.
+The filing location for the Form 4506-T has changed. Please
+see Chart for individual transcripts or Chart for all other
+transcripts for the correct mailing location.
+What’s New. As part of its ongoing efforts to protect
+taxpayer data, the Internal Revenue Service announced that
+in July 2019, it will stop all third-party mailings of requested
+transcripts. After this date masked Tax Transcripts will only
+be mailed to the taxpayer’s address of record.
+If a third-party is unable to accept a Tax Transcript mailed to
+the taxpayer, they may either contract with an existing IVES
+participant or become an IVES participant themselves. For
+additional information about the IVES program, go to
+www.irs.gov and search IVES.
+General Instructions
+Caution: Do not sign this form unless all applicable lines
+have been completed.
+Purpose of form. Use Form 4506-T to request tax return
+information. Taxpayers using a tax year beginning in one
+calendar year and ending in the following year (fiscal tax year)
+must file Form 4506-T to request a return transcript.
+Note: If you are unsure of which type of transcript you need,
+request the Record of Account, as it provides the most
+detailed information.
+Customer File Number. The transcripts provided by the IRS
+have been modified to protect taxpayers' privacy. Transcripts
+only display partial personal information, such as the last four
+digits of the taxpayer's Social Security Number. Full financial
+and tax information, such as wages and taxable income, are
+shown on the transcript.
+An optional Customer File Number field is available to use
+when requesting a transcript. This number will print on the
+transcript. See Line 5 instructions for specific requirements.
+The customer file number is an optional field and not
+required.
+Tip. Use Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return, to
+request copies of tax returns.
+Automated transcript request. You can quickly request
+transcripts by using our automated self-help service tools.
+Please visit us at IRS.gov and click on “Get a Tax
+Transcript...” under “Tools” or call 1-800-908-9946.
+Where to file. Mail or fax Form 4506-T to the address below
+for the state you lived in, or the state your business was in,
+when that return was filed. There are two address charts: one
+for individual transcripts (Form 1040 series and Form W-2)
+and one for all other transcripts.
+If you are requesting more than one transcript or other
+product and the chart shows two different addresses, send
+your request to the address based on the address of your
+most recent return.
+Line 1b. Enter your employer identification number (EIN) if
+your request relates to a business return. Otherwise, enter the
+first social security number (SSN) or your individual taxpayer
+identification number (ITIN) shown on the return. For
+example, if you are requesting Form 1040 that includes
+Schedule C (Form 1040), enter your SSN.
+Line 3. Enter your current address. If you use a P.O. box,
+include it on this line.
+Line 4. Enter the address shown on the last return filed if
+different from the address entered on line 3.
+Note: If the addresses on lines 3 and 4 are different and you
+have not changed your address with the IRS, file Form 8822,
+Change of Address. For a business address, file Form 8822-
+B, Change of Address or Responsible Party — Business.
+Line 5. Enter up to 10 numeric characters to create a unique
+customer file number that will appear on the transcript. The
+customer file number should not contain an SSN.
+Completion of this line is not required.
+Note. If you use an SSN, name or combination of both, we
+will not input the information and the customer file number
+will reflect a generic entry of “9999999999” on the transcript.
+Line 6. Enter only one tax form number per request.
+Signature and date. Form 4506-T must be signed and dated
+by the taxpayer listed on line 1a or 2a. The IRS must receive
+Form 4506-T within 120 days of the date signed by the
+taxpayer or it will be rejected. Ensure that all applicable lines
+are completed before signing.
+▲!
+CAUTION
+You must check the box in the signature area
+to acknowledge you have the authority to sign
+and request the information. The form will not
+be processed and returned to you if the
+box is unchecked.
+Individuals. Transcripts of jointly filed tax returns may be
+furnished to either spouse. Only one signature is required.
+Sign Form 4506-T exactly as your name appeared on the
+original return. If you changed your name, also sign your
+current name.
+Corporations. Generally, Form 4506-T can be signed by:
+(1) an officer having legal authority to bind the corporation, (2)
+any person designated by the board of directors or other
+governing body, or (3) any officer or employee on written
+request by any principal officer and attested to by the
+secretary or other officer. A bona fide shareholder of record
+owning 1 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the
+corporation may submit a Form 4506-T but must provide
+documentation to support the requester's right to receive the
+information.
+Partnerships. Generally, Form 4506-T can be signed by
+any person who was a member of the partnership during any
+part of the tax period requested on line 9.
+All others. See section 6103(e) if the taxpayer has died, is
+insolvent, is a dissolved corporation, or if a trustee, guardian,
+executor, receiver, or administrator is acting for the taxpayer.
+Note: If you are Heir at law, Next of kin, or Beneficiary you
+must be able to establish a material interest in the estate or
+trust.
+Documentation. For entities other than individuals, you
+must attach the authorization document. For example, this
+could be the letter from the principal officer authorizing an
+employee of the corporation or the letters testamentary
+authorizing an individual to act for an estate.
+Signature by a representative. A representative can sign
+Form 4506-T for a taxpayer only if the taxpayer has
+specifically delegated this authority to the representative on
+Form 2848, line 5. The representative must attach Form 2848
+showing the delegation to Form 4506-T.

+Visual Studio Code on Linux
+
+Installation
+
+See the Download Visual Studio Code page for a complete list of available installation options.
+
+By downloading and using Visual Studio Code, you agree to the license terms and privacy statement.
+
+Debian and Ubuntu based distributions
+
+The easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions is to download and install the .deb package (64-bit), either through the graphical software center if it's available, or through the command line with:
+
+sudo apt install ./<file>.deb # If you're on an older Linux distribution, you will need to run this instead: # sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb # sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies 
+
+Note that other binaries are also available on the VS Code download page.
+
+Installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating using the system's package manager. Alternatively, the repository and key can also be installed manually with the following script:
+
+sudo apt-get install wget gpg wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list' rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg 
+
+Then update the package cache and install the package using:
+
+sudo apt install apt-transport-https sudo apt update sudo apt install code # or code-insiders 
+
+RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS based distributions
+
+We currently ship the stable 64-bit VS Code in a yum repository, the following script will install the key and repository:
+
+sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo' 
+
+Then update the package cache and install the package using dnf (Fedora 22 and above):
+
+dnf check-update sudo dnf install code 
+
+Or on older versions using yum:
+
+yum check-update sudo yum install code 
+
+Due to the manual signing process and the system we use to publish, the yum repo may lag behind and not get the latest version of VS Code immediately.
+
+Snap
+
+Visual Studio Code is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:
+
+￼
+
+You can install it by running:
+
+sudo snap install --classic code # or code-insiders 
+
+Once installed, the Snap daemon will take care of automatically updating VS Code in the background. You will get an in-product update notification whenever a new update is available.
+
+Note: If snap isn't available in your Linux distribution, please check the following Installing snapd guide, which can help you get that set up.
+
+Learn more about snaps from the official Snap Documentation.
+
+openSUSE and SLE-based distributions
+
+The yum repository above also works for openSUSE and SLE-based systems, the following script will install the key and repository:
+
+sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ntype=rpm-md\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscode.repo' 
+
+Then update the package cache and install the package using:
+
+sudo zypper refresh sudo zypper install code 
+
+AUR package for Arch Linux
+
+There is a community-maintained Arch User Repository package for VS Code.
+
+To get more information about the installation from the AUR, please consult the following wiki entry: Install AUR Packages.
+
+Nix package for NixOS (or any Linux distribution using Nix package manager)
+
+There is a community maintained VS Code Nix package in the nixpkgs repository. In order to install it using Nix, set allowUnfree option to true in your config.nix and execute:
+
+nix-env -i vscode 
+
+Installing .rpm package manually
+
+The VS Code .rpm package (64-bit) can also be manually downloaded and installed, however, auto-updating won't work unless the repository above is installed. Once downloaded it can be installed using your package manager, for example with dnf:
+
+sudo dnf install <file>.rpm 
+
+Note that other binaries are also available on the VS Code download page.
+
+Updates
+
+VS Code ships monthly and you can see when a new release is available by checking the release notes. If the VS Code repository was installed correctly, then your system package manager should handle auto-updating in the same way as other packages on the system.
+
+Note: Updates are automatic and run in the background for the Snap package.
+
+Node.js
+
+Node.js is a popular platform and runtime for easily building and running JavaScript applications. It also includes npm, a Package Manager for Node.js modules. You'll see Node.js and npm mentioned frequently in our documentation and some optional VS Code tooling requires Node.js (for example, the VS Code extension generator).
+
+If you'd like to install Node.js on Linux, see Installing Node.js via package manager to find the Node.js package and installation instructions tailored to your Linux distribution. You can also install and support multiple versions of Node.js by using the Node Version Manager.
+
+To learn more about JavaScript and Node.js, see our Node.js tutorial, where you'll learn about running and debugging Node.js applications with VS Code.
+
+Setting VS Code as the default text editor
+
+xdg-open
+
+You can set the default text editor for text files (text/plain) that is used by xdg-open with the following command:
+
+xdg-mime default code.desktop text/plain 
+
+Debian alternatives system
+
+Debian-based distributions allow setting a default editor using the Debian alternatives system, without concern for the MIME type. You can set this by running the following and selecting code:
+
+sudo update-alternatives --set editor /usr/bin/code 
+
+If Visual Studio Code doesn't show up as an alternative to editor, you need to register it:
+
+sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/editor editor $(which code) 10 
+
+Windows as a Linux developer machine
+
+Another option for Linux development with VS Code is to use a Windows machine with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
+
+Windows Subsystem for Linux
+
+With WSL, you can install and run Linux distributions on Windows. This enables you to develop and test your source code on Linux while still working locally on a Windows machine. WSL supports Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, and Alpine available from the Microsoft Store.
+
+When coupled with the WSL extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of a Linux distro on WSL.
+
+See the Developing in WSL documentation to learn more or try the Working in WSL introductory tutorial.
+
+Next steps
+
+Once you have installed VS Code, these topics will help you learn more about it:
+
+Additional Components - Learn how to install Git, Node.js, TypeScript, and tools like Yeoman.
+
+User Interface - A quick orientation to VS Code.
+
+User/Workspace Settings - Learn how to configure VS Code to your preferences through settings.
+
+Common questions
+
+Azure VM Issues
+
+I'm getting a "Running without the SUID sandbox" error?
+
+You can safely ignore this error.
+
+Debian and moving files to trash
+
+If you see an error when deleting files from the VS Code Explorer on the Debian operating system, it might be because the trash implementation that VS Code is using is not there.
+
+Run these commands to solve this issue:
+
+sudo apt-get install gvfs-bin 
+
+Conflicts with VS Code packages from other repositories
+
+Some distributions, for example Pop!_OS provide their own code package. To ensure the official VS Code repository is used, create a file named /etc/apt/preferences.d/code with the following content:
+
+Package: code Pin: origin "packages.microsoft.com" Pin-Priority: 9999 
+
+"Visual Studio Code is unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace" (error ENOSPC)
+
+When you see this notification, it indicates that the VS Code file watcher is running out of handles because the workspace is large and contains many files. Before adjusting platform limits, make sure that potentially large folders, such as Python .venv, are added to the files.watcherExclude setting (more details below). The current limit can be viewed by running:
+
+cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches 
+
+The limit can be increased to its maximum by editing /etc/sysctl.conf (except on Arch Linux, read below) and adding this line to the end of the file:
+
+fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 
+
+The new value can then be loaded in by running sudo sysctl -p.
+
+While 524,288 is the maximum number of files that can be watched, if you're in an environment that is particularly memory constrained, you may want to lower the number. Each file watch takes up 1080 bytes, so assuming that all 524,288 watches are consumed, that results in an upper bound of around 540 MiB.
+
+Arch-based distros (including Manjaro) require you to change a different file; follow these steps instead.
+
+Another option is to exclude specific workspace directories from the VS Code file watcher with the files.watcherExclude setting. The default for files.watcherExclude excludes node_modules and some folders under .git, but you can add other directories that you don't want VS Code to track.
+
+"files.watcherExclude": { "**/.git/objects/**": true, "**/.git/subtree-cache/**": true, "**/node_modules/*/**": true } 
+
+I can't see Chinese characters in Ubuntu
+
+We're working on a fix. In the meantime, open the application menu, then choose File > Preferences > Settings. In the Text Editor > Font section, set "Font Family" to Droid Sans Mono, Droid Sans Fallback. If you'd rather edit the settings.json file directly, set editor.fontFamily as shown:
+
+"editor.fontFamily": "Droid Sans Mono, Droid Sans Fallback" 
+
+Package git is not installed
+
+This error can appear during installation and is typically caused by the package manager's lists being out of date. Try updating them and installing again:
+
+# For .deb sudo apt-get update # For .rpm (Fedora 21 and below) sudo yum check-update # For .rpm (Fedora 22 and above) sudo dnf check-update 
+
+The code bin command does not bring the window to the foreground on Ubuntu
+
+Running code . on Ubuntu when VS Code is already open in the current directory will not bring VS Code into the foreground. This is a feature of the OS which can be disabled using ccsm.
+
+# Install sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager # Run ccsm 
+
+Under General > General Options > Focus & Raise Behaviour, set "Focus Prevention Level" to "Off". Remember this is an OS-level setting that will apply to all applications, not just VS Code.
+
+Cannot install .deb package due to "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list: No such file or directory"
+
+This can happen when sources.list.d doesn't exist or you don't have access to create the file. To fix this, try manually creating the folder and an empty vscode.list file:
+
+sudo mkdir /etc/apt/sources.list.d sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list 
+
+Cannot move or resize the window while X forwarding a remote window
+
+If you are using X forwarding to use VS Code remotely, you will need to use the native title bar to ensure you can properly manipulate the window. You can switch to using it by setting window.titleBarStyle to native.
+
+Using the custom title bar
+
+The custom title bar and menus were enabled by default on Linux for several months. The custom title bar has been a success on Windows, but the customer response on Linux suggests otherwise. Based on feedback, we have decided to make this setting opt-in on Linux and leave the native title bar as the default.
+
+The custom title bar provides many benefits including great theming support and better accessibility through keyboard navigation and screen readers. Unfortunately, these benefits do not translate as well to the Linux platform. Linux has a variety of desktop environments and window managers that can make the VS Code theming look foreign to users. For users needing the accessibility improvements, we recommend enabling the custom title bar when running in accessibility mode using a screen reader. You can still manually set the title bar with the Window: Title Bar Style (window.titleBarStyle) setting.
+
+Broken cursor in editor with display scaling enabled
+
+Due to an upstream issue #14787 with Electron, the mouse cursor may render incorrectly with scaling enabled. If you notice that the usual text cursor is not being rendered inside the editor as you would expect, try falling back to the native menu bar by configuring the setting window.titleBarStyle to native.
+
+Repository changed its origin value
+
+If you receive an error similar to the following:
+
+E: Repository '...' changed its 'Origin' value from '...' to '...' N: This must be accepted explicitly before updates for this repository can be applied. See apt-secure(8) manpage for details. 
+
+Use apt instead of apt-get and you will be prompted to accept the origin change:
+
+sudo autdeAt update

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence++of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5+million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.+(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.+(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.++Page 17++JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.+COMMERCIAL BANKING+FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS+(in millions, except ratio data)++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019++INCOME STATEMENT+REVENUE+Lending- and deposit-related fees (a) $ 325 $ 304 $ 297 $ 261 $ 256 7 % 27 % $ 1,187 $ 941 26 %+All other income (a) 550 457 526 347 436 20 26 1,880 1,769 6+Noninterest revenue 875 761 823 608 692 15 26 3,067 2,710 13+Net interest income 1,588 1,524 1,577 1,557 1,604 4 (1) 6,246 6,554 (5)+TOTAL NET REVENUE (b) 2,463 2,285 2,400 2,165 2,296 8 7 9,313 9,264 1+Provision for credit losses (1,181) (147) 2,431 1,010 110 NM NM 2,113 296 NM+NONINTEREST EXPENSE+Compensation expense 460 492 430 472 444 (7) 4 1,854 1,785 4+Noncompensation expense 490 477 463 514 497 3 (1) 1,944 1,950 —+TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE 950 969 893 986 941 (2) 1 3,798 3,735 2+Income/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit) 2,694 1,463 (924) 169 1,245 84 116 3,402 5,233 (35)+Income tax expense/(benefit) 660 377 (243) 30 300 75 120 824 1,275 (35)+NET INCOME/(LOSS) $ 2,034 $ 1,086 $ (681) $ 139 $ 945 87 115 $ 2,578 $ 3,958 (35)+Revenue by product+Lending $ 1,177 $ 1,138 $ 1,127 $ 954 $ 1,027 3 15 $ 4,396 $ 4,057 8+Wholesale payments 945 867 925 978 1,020 9 (7) 3,715 4,200 (12)+Investment banking (c) 318 260 256 235 211 22 51 1,069 919 16+Other 23 20 92 (2) 38 15 (39) 133 88 51+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+Investment banking revenue, gross (d) $ 971 $ 840 $ 851 $ 686 $ 634 16 53 $ 3,348 $ 2,744 22+Revenue by client segment+Middle Market Banking $ 947 $ 880 $ 870 $ 943 $ 937 8 1 $ 3,640 $ 3,805 (4)+Corporate Client Banking 856 808 866 673 758 6 13 3,203 3,119 3+Commercial Real Estate Banking 630 576 566 541 537 9 17 2,313 2,169 7+Other 30 21 98 8 64 43 (53) 157 171 (8)+Total Commercial Banking net revenue (b) $ 2,463 $ 2,285 $ 2,400 $ 2,165 $ 2,296 8 7 $ 9,313 $ 9,264 1+FINANCIAL RATIOS+ROE 36 % 19 % (13) % 2 % 16 % 11 % 17 %+Overhead ratio 39 42 37 46 41 41 40+In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each+case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.+Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and+securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact+related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.+(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing+the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.+(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less+goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a+percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as+investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.+(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at+fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful+assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.+(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the+Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net+yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and+analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are+primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.++QUARTERLY TRENDS FULL YEAR++4Q20 Change 2020 Change+(in millions, except rates) 4Q20 3Q20 2Q20 1Q20 4Q19 3Q20 4Q19 2020 2019 2019+Net interest income - reported $ 13,258 $ 13,013 $ 13,853 $ 14,439 $ 14,166 2 % (6) % $ 54,563 $ 57,245 (5) %+Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments 97 104 107 110 123 (7) (21) 418 531 (21)+Net interest income - managed basis (a) $ 13,355 $ 13,117 $ 13,960 $ 14,549 $ 14,289 2 (7) $ 54,981 $ 57,776 (5)+Less: CIB Markets net interest income 2,166 2,076 2,536 1,596 1,149 4 89 8,374 3,120 168+Net interest income excluding CIB Markets (a) $ 11,189 $ 11,041 $ 11,424 $ 12,953 $ 13,140 1 (15) $ 46,607 $ 54,656 (15)+Average interest-earning assets (b) $ 2,955,646 $ 2,874,974 $ 2,819,689 $ 2,465,549 $ 2,377,544 3 24 $ 2,779,710 $ 2,345,279 19+Less: Average CIB Markets interest-earning assets (b) 743,337 730,141 795,511 735,852 676,566 2 10 751,131 672,417 12+Average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets $ 2,212,309 $ 2,144,833 $ 2,024,178 $ 1,729,697 $ 1,700,978 3 30 $ 2,028,579 $ 1,672,862 21+Net yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 1.80 % 1.82 % 1.99 % 2.37 % 2.38 % 1.98 % 2.46 %+Net yield on average CIB Markets interest-earning assets 1.16 1.13 1.28 0.87 0.67 1.11 0.46+Net yield on average interest-earning assets excluding CIB Markets 2.01 2.05 2.27 3.01 3.06 2.30 3.27+(a) Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

+#1330 proposes to add confirmation to risky commands. It is a nice feature to have, but in order to support proper scriptability, we should support a flag (preferably  -y , like in most CLIs), to skip asking for confirmation. So for each of the 4 commands mentioned there (and possibly even more in the future), we should add support for the  -y  flag

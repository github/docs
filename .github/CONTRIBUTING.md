For repository-specific setup, read the [README](../README.md) file. The official docs site also provides these helpful resources:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Contribution types and what we're looking for

Content we accept:
* Technical and grammatical corrections
* Typo fixes
* Expanded explanations of existing products or features, when the expansion has a compelling reason
* New content filling important gaps in our documentation. For example, [this pull request](https://github.com/github/docs/pull/38048) added a useful section on security hardening for GitHub Actions.

Content we do not currently accept:
* Edits purely for tone, readability, or efficiency
* Topics that are too niche or a matter of personal preference
* Changes to the underlying site and workflows

These are general guidelines, but if youâ€™re not sure what category your proposed change would fall under, feel free to open an issue to discuss it with us!

## Getting started

ðŸ“š **Primary resource:** [docs.github.com/en/contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing) contains our complete contribution workflow and policies.

For repository-specific information:
- See [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/README.md) :confetti_ball:
- Check our [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept
- Review our markdown style guidelines in the `/contributing` directory

### Writing style guidelines

When contributing content, please follow these key principles from our [style guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide):

- **Clarity and simplicity**: The goal of our writing style is clarity and simplicity.
- **Meaning over grammar**: Grammatical correctness is important, but not as important as clarity and meaning.
- **Second person**: The docs use second-person ("you") to communicate directly with readers.
- **Inclusive language**: Use inclusive language by not assuming gender or ability level, and by avoiding slang and idioms.
- **Accessible technical language**: Jargon is sometimes necessary, but don't assume every reader has your technical expertise.
- **Active voice**: Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice means avoiding "be" verbs like "is" or "are" when you can, but also choosing more dynamic verbs to get your point across. "Press (a key)" is less dynamic than "tap (a key)," for example.
- **Clear terminology**: Avoid technical abbreviations like "repo" and "PR," and Latin abbreviations like "i.e." and "e.g."

For complete style guidance, see our [style guide](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/style-guide-and-content-model/style-guide).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix-based systems use `\n`. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

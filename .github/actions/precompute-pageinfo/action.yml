    # The caching technique here is to "unboundedly" add to the cache.
    # By unboundedly, it means the cached item will grow and grow.
    # The general idea is that we A) restore from cache, B) replace the
    # file by running the script, and C) save the file back to cache.
    # Optionally, you can have it just do A (and not B and C).

    # When we use this composite action from the workflows like
    # Azure Preview Deploy and Azure Production Deploy, we don't have
    # any Node installed or any of its packages. I.e. we never
    # run `npm ci` in those actions. For security sake.
    # So we can't do things that require Node code.
    # Tests and others will omit the `restore-only` input, but
    # prepping for Docker build and push, will set it to a non-empty
    # string which basically means "If you can restore it, great.
    # If not, that's fine, don't bother".

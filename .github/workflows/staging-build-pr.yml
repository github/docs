name: Staging - Build PR

# **What it does**: Builds PRs before deploying them.
# **Why we have it**: Because it's not safe to share our deploy secrets with forked repos: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
# **Who does it impact**: All contributors.

# IT'S CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS WORKFLOW IS ONLY ENABLED IN docs!

# This allows a subsequently queued workflow run to interrupt previous runs
# These are different from the concurrency in that here it checks if the
# whole workflow runs again. The "inner concurrency" is used for

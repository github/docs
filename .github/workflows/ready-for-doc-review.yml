name: Ready for docs-content review

# **What it does**: Adds pull requests in the docs-internal repository to the docs-content review board when the "ready-for-doc-review" label is added or when a review by docs-content or docs-reviewers is requested. This workflow is also called as a reusable workflow from other repos including docs-content, docs-strategy, docs-early-access, and github.
# **Why we have it**: So that other GitHub teams can easily request reviews from the docs-content team, and so that writers can see when a PR is ready for review
# **Who does it impact**: Writers who need to review docs-related PRs

name: Ready for docs-content review

# **What it does**: Adds pull requests in the docs-internal repository to the docs-content review board when the "ready-for-doc-review" label is added
# **Why we have it**: So that other GitHub teams can easily request reviews from the docs-content team, and so that writers can see when a PR is ready for review
# **Who does it impact**: Writers working in the docs-internal repository

name: OS Ready for review

# **What it does**: Adds pull requests and issues in the docs repository to the docs-content review board when the "waiting for review" label is added
# **Why we have it**: So that contributors in the OS repo can easily get reviews from the docs-content team, and so that writers can see when a PR is ready for review
# **Who does it impact**: Writers working in the docs repository

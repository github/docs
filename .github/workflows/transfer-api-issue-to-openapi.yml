name: Transfer REST API issue to rest-api-description

# **What it does**: Transfers an issue in the open source repo to the open source rest-api-description repo
# **Why we have it**: Requests to change the OpenAPI schema (unless the schema is just a description update) should be made in github/rest-api-description
# **Who does it impact**: Open source and docs-content maintainers

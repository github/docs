name: Repo Freeze Check

# **What it does**: Prevent pull requests from merging during freezes.
# **Why we have it**: Sometimes we need to freeze deployments for various reasons.
# **Who does it impact**: Anyone working on docs.

# **IMPORTANT:** Do not change the FREEZE environment variable set here!
# This workflow runs on a recurring basis. To temporarily disable it (e.g.,
# during a docs deployment freeze), add an Actions Secret to the repo settings
# called `FREEZE` with a value of `true`. To re-enable Audit Logs updates, simply
# delete that Secret from the repo settings. The environment variable here
# will duplicate that Secret's value for later evaluation.

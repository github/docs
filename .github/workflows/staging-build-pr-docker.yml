name: Staging - Build PR Docker

# **What it does**: Builds PRs before deploying them.
# **Why we have it**: Because it's not safe to share our deploy secrets with forked repos: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
# **Who does it impact**: All contributors.

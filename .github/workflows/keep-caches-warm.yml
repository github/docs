name: Keep caches warm

# **What it does**:
#   Makes sure the caching of ./node_modules and ./.next is kept warm
#   for making other pull requests faster.
#   We also use this workflow to precompute other things so that the
#   actions cache is warmed up with data available during deployment
#   actions. When you use actions/cache within a run on `main`
#   what gets saved can be used by other pull requests. But it's
#   also so that when we make preview or production deployments,
#   we can just rely on the cache to already be warmed up.
# **Why we have it**:
#   A PR workflow that depends on caching can't reuse a
#   cached artifact acorss PRs unless it also runs on `main`.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs engineering, open-source engineering contributors.

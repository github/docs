name: Check for unallowed internal changes

# **What it does**: If someone changes app.json or search indexes, we fail the check.
# **Why we have it**: app.json should rarely be edited, so we'll require an admin merge if the file really needs to be changed. The search indexes are synced every 4 hours, so changes should not need to be made.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs engineering and content writers.

name: Local development

# **What it does**: Can you start the local server like a writer would do?
# **Why we have it**: Our CI is often heavily geared on testing in "production"
#                     that historically we've been known to break local
#                     development sometimes.
# **Who does it impact**: Engineers, Contributors.

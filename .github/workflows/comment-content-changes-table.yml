name: Content Changes Table Comment

# **What it does**: When a PR is opened in docs-internal or docs, it adds the staging review and live article links in a Content Directory Changes table in a comment
# **Why we have it**: To help Docs Content team members and contributors automatically have their staging/live article links added to the table
# **Who does it impact**: docs-internal/docs maintainers and contributors

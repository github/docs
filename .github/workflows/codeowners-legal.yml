name: Codeowners - Legal

# **What it does**: Enforces reviews of Responsible AI (RAI) content by the GitHub legal team. Because RAI content can live anywhere in the content directory, it becomes a maintenance problem to use CODEOWNERS to enforce review on each article.
# **Why we have it**: RAI content must be reviewed by the GitHub legal team.
# **Who does it impact**: Content writers and the GitHub legal team.

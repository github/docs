name: Close bad repo-sync PRs

# **What it does**:
#   Closes and PR from `repo-sync` to `main` that wasn't created by a Hubber.
# **Why we have it**:
#   Unfortunately, a lot of PRs in github/docs are created by people who
#   shouldn't be creating such PRs. We bot our bots to own it.
# **Who does it impact**: Open-source.

on:
  # Necessary in lieu of `pull_request` so that PRs opened from forks can be closed if they try to push to a repo sync branch.

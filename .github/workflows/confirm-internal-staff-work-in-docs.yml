name: Confirm internal staff meant to post in public

# **What it does**: If a GitHub staff makes an issue/pull request in the open-source repo, creates an issue in the internal one to verify intent.
# **Why we have it**: We don't want GitHub staff accidentally making issues/pull requests in the wrong repository.
# **Who does it impact**: GitHub staff.

name: Enterprise Server Release Search Sync

# **What it does**: This workflow is used during the Enterprise Server release
# process. The Enterprise release checklist includes a step to add a label in
# the format `sync-english-index-for-enterprise-server@<RELEASE NUMBER>`. When
# that label is added, this workflow runs anytime new commits are made to the
# Enterprise release megabranch. The Docubot user commits the search indexes in
# the `lib/search/indexes` directory.
#
# **Why we have it**: The Lunr index for the next Enterprise release doesn't yet
# exist, so we need to generate it. Search wouldn't work at all if we shipped
# the new release without shipping the index for that release at the same time.
#
# **Who does it impact**: The DRI for the Enterprise release, the content
# writers that are a part of the release and the docs-engineering DRI.

          - When you're ready for the Docs team to review this PR, apply the **ready-for-doc-review** label and your PR will be added to the [Docs Content review board](https://github.com/orgs/github/memexes/901?layout=table&groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=11024). **Please factor in at least 72 hours for a review, even longer if this is a substantial change.**
          - If this is a major update to the docs, you might want to go back and open an [issue](https://github.com/github/docs-content/issues/new/choose) to ensure we've covered all areas of the docs in these updates. Not doing so may result in delays or inaccurate documentation."

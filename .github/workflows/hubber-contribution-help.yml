          - When you're ready for the Docs team to review this PR, add the *ready-for-doc-review* label to your PR, and it will be automatically added to the [Docs Content review board](https://github.com/orgs/github/memexes/901?layout=table&groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=11024). **Please factor in at least 72 hours for a review, even longer if this is a substantial change.**
          - If you're adding a release note, request a technical review. The Docs team will review the PR after the technical review is complete.
          - If your updates to the docs are more than a simple fix, you might want to go back and open an [issue](https://github.com/github/docs-content/issues/new/choose) to ensure we've covered all areas of the docs in these updates. Not doing so may result in delays or inaccurate documentation."

name: Azure - Deploy Preview Environment (private)

# NOTE! This is specifically and only for github/docs-internal.

# **What it does**: Build and deploy an Azure preview environment for this PR in github/docs-internal
# **Why we have it**: It's our preview environment deploy mechanism, to docs-internal repo
# **Who does it impact**: Writ-access contributors.

  # The advantage of 'pull_request' over 'pull_request_target' is that we
  # can make changes to this file and test them in a pull request, instead
  # of relying on landing it in 'main' first.
  # From a security point of view, its arguably safer this way because
  # unlike 'pull_request_target', these only have secrets if the pull
  # request creator has permission to access secrets.

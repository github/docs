name: Reviewers - Docs Engineering

# **What it does**: Automatically add reviewers based on paths, but only for the docs-internal repo.
# And sets the 'engineering' label on the PR. It also edits the PR body to add a template
# for asking questions for the sake of being confident about the PRs rollout.
# **Why we have it**: So we can have reviewers automatically without getting open source notifications.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs team.

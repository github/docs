name: Don't delete assets

# **What it does**:
#   If the PR (against main) involves deletion of assets, if any of
#   them are deletions or renames, post a comment, and ultimately
#   fail the check.
# **Why we have it**:
#    If you delete the reference to an image, the English content is fine
#    because it no longer tries to serve an image that doesn't exist.
#    But this is not the case for translations.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs content.

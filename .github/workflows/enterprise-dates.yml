name: Enterprise date updater

# **What it does**: Runs on a schedule to update lib/enterprise-dates.json.
# **Why we have it**: The lib/enterprise-dates.json file needs to be up-to-date
# for the .github/workflows/open-enterprise-issue.yml workflow and the
# tests/content/search.js test.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs engineering, docs content.

  schedule:
    - cron: '39 2 * * 2' # At 02:39 on Tuesday

# **IMPORTANT:** Do not change the FREEZE environment variable set here!
# This workflow runs on a recurring basis. To temporarily disable it (e.g.,
# during a docs deployment freeze), add an Actions Secret to the repo settings
# called `FREEZE` with a value of `true`. To re-enable updates, simply
# delete that Secret from the repo settings. The environment variable here
# will duplicate that Secret's value for later evaluation.

name: Index general search in Elasticsearch on PR

# **What it does**: This does what `index-general-search-elasticsearch.yml` does but
#                   with a localhost Elasticsearch and only for English.
# **Why we have it**: To test that the script works and the popular pages json is valid.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs engineering

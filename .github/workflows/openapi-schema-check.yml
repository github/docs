name: OpenAPI dev mode check

# **What it does**: Checks that the files in lib/rest/static/decorated match
#   the files in lib/rest/static/dereferenced. Checks that the decorated
#   schemas in lib/rest/static/decorated are not in development mode.
#   Development mode schemas have a branch name and development mode tag in the
#   info.version property.
# **Why we have it**: To ensure that we aren't every shipping decorated schemas
#   that are out of sync with the source derefereced schema. To ensure that
#   decorated schemas generated locally are not published. Locally generated
#   decorated schemas are pushing up to the remote for staging purposes only.
# **Who does it impact**: Docs content writers updating REST API docs and
#   the docs engineering team as maintainers of the scripts and workflows.

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
Create Pull Request action will:
1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes: - untracked (new) files - tracked (modified) files - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.
## Documentation
- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)- [Examples](docs/examples.md)- [Updating to v4](docs/updating.md)
## Usage
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v4.x.x`
### Workflow permissions
For this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests.This setting can be found in a repository's settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
For repositories belonging to an organization, this setting can be managed by admins in organization settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
### Action inputs
All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.
**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: push` or `on: pull_request` workflow then you cannot use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.
| Name | Description | Default || --- | --- | --- || `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` || `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` || `add-paths` | A comma or newline-separated list of file paths to commit. Paths should follow git's [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax. If no paths are specified, all new and modified files are added. See [Add specific paths](#add-specific-paths). | || `commit-message` | The message to use when committing changes. | `[create-pull-request] automated change` || `committer` | The committer name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. | `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` || `author` | The author name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. | `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>` || `signoff` | Add [`Signed-off-by`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. | `false` || `branch` | The pull request branch name. | `create-pull-request/patch` || `delete-branch` | Delete the `branch` when closing pull requests, and when undeleted after merging. Recommend `true`. | `false` || `branch-suffix` | The branch suffix type when using the alternative branching strategy. Valid values are `random`, `timestamp` and `short-commit-hash`. See [Alternative strategy](#alternative-strategy---always-create-a-new-pull-request-branch) for details. | || `base` | Sets the pull request base branch. | Defaults to the branch checked out in the workflow. || `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See [push pull request branches to a fork](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details. | || `title` | The title of the pull request. | `Changes by create-pull-request action` || `body` | The body of the pull request. | `Automated changes by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub action` || `labels` | A comma or newline-separated list of labels. | || `assignees` | A comma or newline-separated list of assignees (GitHub usernames). | || `reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of reviewers (GitHub usernames) to request a review from. | || `team-reviewers` | A comma or newline-separated list of GitHub teams to request a review from. Note that a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) may be required. See [this issue](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/155). If using a GitHub App, refer to [Authenticating with GitHub App generated tokens](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens) for the proper permissions. | || `milestone` | The number of the milestone to associate this pull request with. | || `draft` | Create a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). It is not possible to change draft status after creation except through the web interface. | `false` |
For self-hosted runners behind a corporate proxy set the `https_proxy` environment variable.```yml - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 env: https_proxy: http://<proxy_address>:<port>```
### Action outputs
The following outputs can be used by subsequent workflow steps.
- `pull-request-number` - The pull request number.- `pull-request-url` - The URL of the pull request.- `pull-request-operation` - The pull request operation performed by the action, `created`, `updated` or `closed`.- `pull-request-head-sha` - The commit SHA of the pull request branch.
Step outputs can be accessed as in the following example.Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 - name: Check outputs if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }} run: | echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}" echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"```
### Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.
How the action behaves:
- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.- If a pull request already exists it will be updated if necessary. Local changes in the Actions workspace, or changes on the base branch, can cause an update. If no update is required the action exits silently.- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).
#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.
- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`
- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`
- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`
### Controlling committed files
The action defaults to adding all new and modified files.If there are files that should not be included in the pull request, you can use the following methods to control the committed content.
#### Remove files
The most straightforward way to handle unwanted files is simply to remove them in a step before the action runs.
```yml - run: | rm -rf temp-dir rm temp-file.txt```
#### Ignore files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
#### Add specific paths
You can control which files are committed with the `add-paths` input.Paths should follow git's [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax.All file changes that do not match one of the paths will be discarded.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: add-paths: | *.java docs/*.md```
#### Create your own commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).
```yml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Create commits run: | git config user.name 'Peter Evans' git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com' date +%s > report.txt git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow" date +%s > new-report.txt git add -A git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow" - name: Uncommitted change run: date +%s > report.txt - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
### Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 - name: Create or Update Project Card if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }} uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v2 with: project-name: My project column-name: My column issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}```
### Auto-merge
Auto-merge can be enabled on a pull request allowing it to be automatically merged once requirements have been satisfied.See [enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) action for usage details.
## Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.
```ymljobs: createPullRequest: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Make changes to pull request run: date +%s > report.txt - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} commit-message: Update report committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com> author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com> signoff: false branch: example-patches delete-branch: true title: '[Example] Update report' body: | Update report - Updated with *today's* date - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request labels: | report automated pr assignees: peter-evans reviewers: peter-evans team-reviewers: | owners maintainers milestone: 1 draft: false```
An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.
Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.
Create Pull Request action will:
1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes: - untracked (new) files - tracked (modified) files - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.
## Documentation
- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)- [Examples](docs/examples.md)- [Updating to v4](docs/updating.md)
## Usage
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v4.x.x`
### Workflow permissions
For this action to work you must explicitly allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests.This setting can be found in a repository's settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
For repositories belonging to an organization, this setting can be managed by admins in organization settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions.
### Action inputs
All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.
**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigger an `on: push` or `on: pull_request` workflow then you cannot use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the [documentation here](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for workarounds.
| Name | Description | Default || --- | --- | --- || `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (permissions `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`) or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` || `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` || `add-paths` | A comma or newline-separated list of file paths to commit.

For self-hosted runners behind a corporate proxy set the `https_proxy` environment variable.```yml - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 env: https_proxy: http://<proxy_address>:<port>```
### Action outputs
The following outputs can be used by subsequent workflow steps.
- `pull-request-number` - The pull request number.- `pull-request-url` - The URL of the pull request.- `pull-request-operation` - The pull request operation performed by the action, `created`, `updated` or `closed`.- `pull-request-head-sha` - The commit SHA of the pull request branch.
Step outputs can be accessed as in the following example.Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 - name: Check outputs if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }} run: | echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}" echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"```
### Action behaviour
The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.
How the action behaves:
- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.- If a pull request already exists it will be updated if necessary. Local changes in the Actions workspace, or changes on the base branch, can cause an update. If no update is required the action exits silently.- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.
For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).
#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch
For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.
To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.
- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`
- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`
- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`
### Controlling committed files
The action defaults to adding all new and modified files.If there are files that should not be included in the pull request, you can use the following methods to control the committed content.
#### Remove files
The most straightforward way to handle unwanted files is simply to remove them in a step before the action runs.
```yml - run: | rm -rf temp-dir rm temp-file.txt```
#### Ignore files
If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.
#### Add specific paths
You can control which files are committed with the `add-paths` input.Paths should follow git's [pathspec](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec) syntax.All file changes that do not match one of the paths will be discarded.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: add-paths: | *.java docs/*.md```
#### Create your own commits
As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).
```yml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Create commits run: | git config user.name 'Peter Evans' git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com' date +%s > report.txt git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow" date +%s > new-report.txt git add -A git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow" - name: Uncommitted change run: date +%s > report.txt - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
### Create a project card
To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.
```yml - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 - name: Create or Update Project Card if: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }} uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v2 with: project-name: My project column-name: My column issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}```
### Auto-merge
Auto-merge can be enabled on a pull request allowing it to be automatically merged once requirements have been satisfied.See [enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) action for usage details.
## Reference Example
The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.
See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.
```ymljobs: createPullRequest: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Make changes to pull request run: date +%s > report.txt - name: Create Pull Request id: cpr uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} commit-message: Update report committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com> author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com> signoff: false branch: example-patches delete-branch: true title: '[Example] Update report' body: | Update report - Updated with *today's* date - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request labels: | report automated pr assignees: peter-evans reviewers: peter-evans team-reviewers: | owners maintainers milestone: 1 draft: false```
An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:

## Terminology
[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests) are proposed changes to a repository branch that can be reviewed by a repository's collaborators before being accepted or rejected. 
A pull request references two branches:
- The `base` of a pull request is the branch you intend to change once the proposed changes are merged.- The `branch` of a pull request represents what you intend the `base` to look like when merged. It is the `base` branch *plus* changes that have been made to it.
## Events and checkout
This action expects repositories to be checked out with the official GitHub Actions [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.For each [event type](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) there is a default `GITHUB_SHA` that will be checked out.
The default can be overridden by specifying a `ref` on checkout.
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: develop```
## How the action works
Unless the `base` input is supplied, the action expects the target repository to be checked out on the pull request `base`&mdash;the branch you intend to modify with the proposed changes.
Workflow steps:
1. Checkout the `base` branch2. Make changes3. Execute `create-pull-request` action
The following git diagram shows how the action creates and updates a pull request branch.
![Create Pull Request GitGraph](assets/cpr-gitgraph.png)
## Guidelines
### Providing a consistent base
For the action to work correctly it should be executed in a workflow that checks out a *consistent* base branch. This will be the base of the pull request unless overridden with the `base` input.
This means your workflow should be consistently checking out the branch that you intend to modify once the PR is merged.
In the following example, the [`push`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) and [`create`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#create) events both trigger the same workflow. This will cause the checkout action to checkout inconsistent branches and commits. Do *not* do this. It will cause multiple pull requests to be created for each additional `base` the action is executed against.
```ymlon: push: create:jobs: example: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3```
There may be use cases where it makes sense to execute the workflow on a branch that is not the base of the pull request. In these cases, the base branch can be specified with the `base` action input. The action will attempt to rebase changes made during the workflow on to the actual base.
### Events which checkout a commit
The [default checkout](#events-and-checkout) for the majority of events will leave the repository checked out on a branch.However, some events such as `release` and `pull_request` will leave the repository in a "detached HEAD" state.This is because they checkout a commit, not a branch.In these cases, you *must supply* the `base` input so the action can rebase changes made during the workflow for the pull request.
Workflows triggered by [`pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) events will by default check out a merge commit. Set the `base` input as follows to base the new pull request on the current pull request's branch.
```yml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: base: ${{ github.head_ref }}```
Workflows triggered by [`release`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release) events will by default check out a tag. For most use cases, you will need to set the `base` input to the branch name of the tagged commit.
```yml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: base: main```
### Restrictions on repository forks
GitHub Actions have imposed restrictions on workflow runs triggered by public repository forks.Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) from forks to run without restriction.
The restrictions apply to the `pull_request` event triggered by a fork opening a pull request in the upstream repository.
- Events from forks cannot access secrets, except for the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. > With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository. [GitHub Actions: Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow)
- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only access when an event is triggered by a forked repository.
[GitHub Actions: Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token)
These restrictions mean that during a `pull_request` event triggered by a forked repository, actions have no write access to GitHub resources and will fail on any attempt.
A job condition can be added to prevent workflows from executing when triggered by a repository fork.
```ymlon: pull_requestjobs: example: runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Check if the event is not triggered by a fork if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository```
For further reading regarding the security of pull requests, see this GitHub blog post titled [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
### Triggering further workflow runs
Pull requests created by the action using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger other workflows. If you have `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflows acting as checks on pull requests, they will not run.
> When you use the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs. For example, if a workflow run pushes code using the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when `push` events occur.[GitHub Actions: Triggering a workflow from a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow)
#### Workarounds to trigger further workflow runs
There are a number of workarounds with different pros and cons.
- Use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` and allow the action to create pull requests that have no checks enabled. Manually close pull requests and immediately reopen them. This will enable `on: pull_request` workflows to run and be added as checks. To prevent merging of pull requests without checks erroneously, use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests).
- Use a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) created on an account that has write access to the repository that pull requests are being created in. This is the standard workaround and [recommended by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token). However, the PAT cannot be scoped to a specific repository so the token becomes a very sensitive secret. If this is a concern, the PAT can instead be created for a dedicated [machine account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements) that has collaborator access to the repository. Also note that because the account that owns the PAT will be the creator of pull requests, that user account will be unable to perform actions such as request changes or approve the pull request.
- Use [SSH (deploy keys)](#push-using-ssh-deploy-keys) to push the pull request branch. This is arguably more secure than using a PAT because deploy keys can be set per repository. However, this method will only trigger `on: push` workflows.
- Use a [machine account that creates pull requests from its own fork](#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork). This is the most secure because the PAT created only grants access to the machine account's fork, not the main repository. This method will trigger `on: pull_request` workflows to run. Workflows triggered `on: push` will not run because the push event is in the fork.
- Use a [GitHub App to generate a token](#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens) that can be used with this action. GitHub App generated tokens are more secure than using a PAT because GitHub App access permissions can be set with finer granularity and are scoped to only repositories where the App is installed. This method will trigger both `on: push` and `on: pull_request` workflows.
### Security
From a security perspective it's good practice to fork third-party actions, review the code, and use your fork of the action in workflows.By using third-party actions directly the risk exists that it could be modified to do something malicious, such as capturing secrets.
Alternatively, use the action directly and reference the commit hash for the version you want to target.```yml - uses: thirdparty/foo-action@172ec762f2ac8e050062398456fccd30444f8f30```
This action uses [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the Node.js code and dependencies into a single JavaScript file under the [dist](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/tree/main/dist) directory.
## Advanced usage
### Creating pull requests in a remote repository
Checking out a branch from a different repository from where the workflow is executing will make *that repository* the target for the created pull request. In this case, a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required.
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} repository: owner/repo # Make changes to pull request here - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}```
### Push using SSH (deploy keys)
[Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be set per repository and so are arguably more secure than using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).Allowing the action to push with a configured deploy key will trigger `on: push` workflows. This makes it an alternative to using a PAT to trigger checks for pull requests.Note that you cannot use deploy keys alone to [create a pull request in a remote repository](#creating-pull-requests-in-a-remote-repository) because then using a PAT would become a requirement. This method only makes sense if creating a pull request in the repository where the workflow is running.
How to use SSH (deploy keys) with create-pull-request action:
1. [Create a new SSH key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) for your repository. Do not set a passphrase.2. Copy the contents of the public key (.pub file) to a new repository [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) and check the box to "Allow write access."3. Add a secret to the repository containing the entire contents of the private key.4. As shown in the example below, configure `actions/checkout` to use the deploy key you have created.
```yml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ssh-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }} # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
### Push pull request branches to a fork
Instead of pushing pull request branches to the repository you want to update, you can push them to a fork of that repository.This allows you to employ the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) by using a dedicated user acting as a [machine account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements).This user only has `read` access to the main repository.It will use their own fork to push code and create the pull request.Note that if you choose to use this method (not give the machine account `write` access to the repository) the following inputs cannot be used: `labels`, `assignees`, `reviewers`, `team-reviewers` and `milestone`.
1. Create a new GitHub user and login.2. Fork the repository that you will be creating pull requests in.3. Create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).4. Logout and log back into your main user account.5. Add a secret to your repository containing the above PAT.6. As shown in the following example workflow, set the `push-to-fork` input to the full repository name of the fork.

### Authenticating with GitHub App generated tokens
A GitHub App can be created for the sole purpose of generating tokens for use with GitHub actions.These tokens can be used in place of `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).GitHub App generated tokens are more secure than using a PAT because GitHub App access permissions can be set with finer granularity and are scoped to only repositories where the App is installed.
1. Create a minimal [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app), setting the following fields:
- Set `GitHub App name`. - Set `Homepage URL` to anything you like, such as your GitHub profile page. - Uncheck `Active` under `Webhook`. You do not need to enter a `Webhook URL`. - Under `Repository permissions: Contents` select `Access: Read & write`. - Under `Repository permissions: Pull requests` select `Access: Read & write`. - Under `Organization permissions: Members` select `Access: Read-only`. - **NOTE**: Only needed if you would like add teams as reviewers to PRs.
2. Create a Private key from the App settings page and store it securely.
3. Install the App on any repository where workflows will run requiring tokens.
4. Set secrets on your repository containing the GitHub App ID, and the private key you created in step 2. e.g. `APP_ID`, `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
5. The following example workflow shows how to use [tibdex/github-app-token](https://github.com/tibdex/github-app-token) to generate a token for use with this action.
```yaml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v1 id: generate-token with: app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }} private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }} # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}```
### GPG commit signature verification
The action can use GPG to sign commits with a GPG key that you generate yourself.
1. Follow GitHub's guide to [generate a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key).
2. [Add the public key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account) to the user account associated with the [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) that you will use with the action.
3. Copy the private key to your clipboard, replacing `email@example.com` with the email address of your GPG key. ``` # macOS gpg --armor --export-secret-key email@example.com | pbcopy ```
4. Paste the private key into a repository secret where the workflow will run. e.g. `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
5. Create another repository secret for the key's passphrase, if applicable. e.g. `GPG_PASSPHRASE`
6. The following example workflow shows how to use [crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) to import your GPG key and allow the action to sign commits.
Note that the `committer` email address *MUST* match the email address used to create your GPG key.
```yaml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@v3 with: gpg-private-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }} passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }} git-user-signingkey: true git-commit-gpgsign: true # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} committer: example <email@example.com>```
### Running in a container or on self-hosted runners
This action can be run inside a container, or on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners), by installing the necessary dependencies.
This action requires `git` to be installed and on the `PATH`. Note that `actions/checkout` requires Git 2.18 or higher to be installed, otherwise it will just download the source of the repository instead of cloning it.
The following examples of running in a container show the dependencies being installed during the workflow, but they could also be pre-installed in a custom image.
**Alpine container example:**```ymljobs: createPullRequestAlpine: runs-on: ubuntu-latest container: image: alpine steps: - name: Install dependencies run: apk --no-cache add git - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
**Ubuntu container example:**```ymljobs: createPullRequestAlpine: runs-on: ubuntu-latest container: image: ubuntu steps: - name: Install dependencies run: | apt-get update apt-get install -y software-properties-common add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa apt-get install -y git - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```

## Use case: Create a pull request to update X on push
This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on pushed changes. Care should be taken when using this pattern in repositories with a high frequency of commits.
### Update project authors
Raises a pull request to update a file called `AUTHORS` with the git user names and email addresses of contributors.
```ymlname: Update AUTHORSon: push: branches: - mainjobs: updateAuthors: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Update AUTHORS run: | git log --format='%aN <%aE>%n%cN <%cE>' | sort -u > AUTHORS - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update authors title: Update AUTHORS body: Credit new contributors by updating AUTHORS branch: update-authors```### Keep a branch up-to-date with anotherThis is a use case where a branch should be kept up to date with another by opening a pull request to update it. The pull request should then be updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.In this example scenario, a branch called `production` should be updated via pull request to keep it in sync with `main`. Merging the pull request is effectively promoting those changes to production.```ymlname: Create production promotion pull requeston: push: branches: - mainjobs: productionPromotion: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: production - name: Reset promotion branch run: | git fetch origin main:main git reset --hard main - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: branch: production-promotion```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X on releaseThis pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on the tagged commit of a release. Note that because `release` is one of the [events which checkout a commit](concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit) it is necessary to supply the `base` input to the action.### Update changelogRaises a pull request to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file based on the tagged commit of the release.Note that [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog/) requires some configuration files to exist in the repository before this workflow will work.This workflow assumes the tagged release was made on a default branch called `main`.```ymlname: Update Changelogon: release: types: [published]jobs: updateChangelog: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Update Changelog run: | curl -o git-chglog -L https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog/releases/download/0.9.1/git-chglog_linux_amd64 chmod u+x git-chglog ./git-chglog -o CHANGELOG.md rm git-chglog - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update changelog title: Update Changelog body: Update changelog to reflect release changes branch: update-changelog base: main```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X periodicallyThis pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source. The workflow executes on a schedule and raises a pull request when there are changes.### Update NPM dependenciesThis workflow will create a pull request for npm dependencies.It works best in combination with a build workflow triggered on `push` and `pull_request`.A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) can be used in order for the creation of the pull request to trigger further workflows. See the [documentation here](concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for further details.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: -

Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```The above workflow works best in combination with a build workflow triggered on `push` and `pull_request`.```ymlname: CIon: push: branches: [main] pull_request: branches: [main]jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: 16.x - run: npm ci - run: npm run test - run: npm run build```### Update Gradle dependenciesThe following workflow will create a pull request for Gradle dependencies.It requires first configuring your project to use Gradle lockfiles.See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/gradle-auto-dependency-updates) for how to configure your project and use the following workflow.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 1 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: actions/setup-java@v2 with: distribution: 'temurin' java-version: 1.8 - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew run: chmod +x gradlew -

Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```### Update Cargo dependenciesThe following workflow will create a pull request for Cargo dependencies.It optionally uses [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) to update `Cargo.toml` and keep it in sync with `Cargo.lock`.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 1 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Update dependencies run: | cargo install cargo-edit cargo update cargo upgrade --to-lockfile - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} commit-message: Update dependencies title: Update dependencies body: | - Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```### Update SwaggerUI for GitHub PagesWhen using [GitHub Pages to host Swagger documentation](https://github.com/peter-evans/swagger-github-pages), this workflow updates the repository with the latest distribution of [SwaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).You must create a file called `swagger-ui.version` at the root of your repository before running.```ymlname: Update Swagger UIon: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * *'jobs: updateSwagger: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Get Latest Swagger UI Release id: swagger-ui run: | release_tag=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest | jq -r ".tag_name") echo "release_tag=$release_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT current_tag=$(<swagger-ui.version) echo "current_tag=$current_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT -

It assumes the default branch of the upstream repository is called `main`.The [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) should have `repo` scope. Additionally, if the upstream makes changes to the `.github/workflows` directory, the action will be unable to push the changes to a branch and throw the error "_(refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/xxx.yml` without `workflows` permission)_". To allow these changes to be pushed to the fork, add the `workflow` scope to the PAT. Of course, allowing this comes with the risk that the workflow changes from the upstream could run and do something unexpected. Disabling GitHub Actions in the fork is highly recommended to prevent this.When you merge the pull request make sure to choose the [`Rebase and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) option. This will make the fork's commits match the commits on the upstream.```ymlname: Update forkon: schedule: - cron: '0 0 * * 0'jobs: updateFork: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: repository: fork-owner/repo - name: Reset the default branch with upstream changes run: | git remote add upstream https://github.com/owner/repo.git git fetch upstream main:upstream-main git reset --hard upstream-main - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} branch: upstream-changes```### Spider and download a websiteThis workflow spiders a website and downloads the content. Any changes to the website will be raised in a pull request.```ymlname: Download Websiteon: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * *'jobs: format: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Download website run: | wget \ --recursive \ --level=2 \ --wait=1 \ --no-clobber \ --page-requisites \ --html-extension \ --convert-links \ --domains quotes.toscrape.com \ http://quotes.toscrape.com/ - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update local website copy title: Automated Updates to Local Website Copy body: This is an auto-generated PR with website updates. branch: website-updates```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X by calling the GitHub APIYou can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) when you want to trigger a workflow for any activity that happens outside of GitHub.This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source.You can modify any of the examples in the previous section to work in this fashion.Set the workflow to execute `on: repository_dispatch`.```ymlon: repository_dispatch: types: [create-pull-request]```### Call the GitHub API from an external serviceAn `on: repository_dispatch` workflow can be triggered by a call to the GitHub API as follows.- `[username]` is a GitHub username- `[token]` is a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)- `[repository]` is the name of the repository the workflow resides in.```curl -XPOST -u "[username]:[token]" \ -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repository]/dispatches \ --data '{"event_type": "create-pull-request"}'```### Call the GitHub API from another GitHub Actions workflowAn `on: repository_dispatch` workflow can be triggered from another workflow with [repository-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/repository-dispatch) action.```yml- name: Repository Dispatch uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v2 with: token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }} repository: username/my-repo event-type: create-pull-request client-payload: '{"ref": "${{ github.ref }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'```## Use case: Create a pull request to modify/fix pull requests**Note**: While the following approach does work, my strong recommendation would be to use a slash command style "ChatOps" solution for operations on pull requests. See [slash-command-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) for such a solution.This is a pattern that lends itself to automated code linting and fixing. A pull request can be created to fix or modify something during an `on: pull_request` workflow. The pull request containing the fix will be raised with the original pull request as the base. This can be then be merged to update the original pull request and pass any required tests.Note that due to [token restrictions on public repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token), workflows for this use case do not work for pull requests raised from forks.Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) from forks to run without restriction. ### autopep8The following is an example workflow for a use case where [autopep8 action](https://github.com/peter-evans/autopep8) runs as both a check on pull requests and raises a further pull request to apply code fixes.How it works:1. When a pull request is raised the workflow executes as a check2. If autopep8 makes any fixes a pull request will be raised for those fixes to be merged into the current pull request branch. The workflow then deliberately causes the check to fail.3. When the pull request containing the fixes is merged the workflow runs again. This time autopep8 makes no changes and the check passes.4. The original pull request can now be merged.```ymlname: autopep8on: pull_requestjobs: autopep8: # Check if the PR is not raised by this workflow and is not from a fork if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'autopep8-patches') == false && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: ${{ github.head_ref }} - name: autopep8 id: autopep8 uses: peter-evans/autopep8@v1 with: args: --exit-code --recursive --in-place --aggressive --aggressive . - name: Set autopep8 branch name id: vars run: | branch-name="autopep8-patches/${{ github.head_ref }}" echo "branch-name=$branch-name" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2 uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: autopep8 action fixes title: Fixes by autopep8 action body: This is an auto-generated PR with fixes by autopep8. labels: autopep8, automated pr branch: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.branch-name }} - name: Fail if autopep8 made changes if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2 run: exit 1```## Misc workflow tips### Filtering push eventsFor workflows using `on: push` you may want to ignore push events for tags and only execute for branches. Specifying `branches` causes only events on branches to trigger the workflow. The `'**'` wildcard will match any branch name.```ymlon: push: branches: - '**' ```If you have a workflow that contains jobs to handle push events on branches as well as tags, you can make sure that the job where you use `create-pull-request` action only executes when `github.ref` is a branch by using an `if` condition as follows.```ymlon: pushjobs: createPullRequest: if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/') runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 ... someOtherJob: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 ...```### Dynamic configuration using variablesThe following examples show how configuration for the action can be dynamically defined in a previous workflow step.Note that the step where output variables are defined must have an id.```yml - name: Set output variables id: vars run: | pr_title="[Test] Add report file $(date +%d-%m-%Y)" pr_body="This PR was auto-generated on $(date +%d-%m-%Y) \ by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)." echo "pr_title=$pr_title" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "pr_body=$pr_body" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: title: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_title }} body: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_body }}```### Setting the pull request body from a fileThis example shows how file content can be read into a variable and passed to the action.```yml - id: get-pr-body run: | body=$(cat pr-body.txt) delimiter="$(openssl rand -hex 8)" echo "body<<$delimiter" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "$body" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "$delimiter" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: body: ${{ steps.get-pr-body.outputs.body }}```### Using a markdown templateIn this example, a markdown template file is added to the repository at `.github/pull-request-template.md` with the following content.```This is a test pull request templateRender template variables such as {{ .foo }} and {{ .bar }}.```The template is rendered using the [render-template](https://github.com/chuhlomin/render-template) action and the result is used to create the pull request.```yml - name: Render template id: template uses: chuhlomin/render-template@v1.4 with: template: .github/pull-request-template.md vars: | foo: this bar: that - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: body: ${{ steps.template.outputs.result }}```### Debugging GitHub Actions#### Runner Diagnostic Logging[Runner diagnostic logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-runner-diagnostic-logging) provides additional log files that contain information about how a runner is executing an action.To enable runner diagnostic logging, set the secret `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to `true` in the repository that contains the workflow.#### Step Debug Logging[Step debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-step-debug-logging) increases the verbosity of a job's logs during and after a job's execution.To enable step debug logging set the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true` in the repository that contains the workflow.#### Output Various Contexts```yml steps: - name: Dump GitHub context env: GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }} run: echo "$GITHUB_CONTEXT" - name: Dump job context env: JOB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(job) }} run: echo "$JOB_CONTEXT" - name: Dump steps context env: STEPS_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(steps) }} run: echo "$STEPS_CONTEXT" - name: Dump runner context env: RUNNER_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(runner) }} run: echo "$RUNNER_CONTEXT" - name: Dump strategy context env: STRATEGY_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(strategy) }} run: echo "$STRATEGY_CONTEXT" - name: Dump matrix context env: MATRIX_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(matrix) }} run: echo "$MATRIX_CONTEXT"```

### Breaking changes
- The `add-paths` input no longer accepts `-A` as a valid value. When committing all new and modified files the `add-paths` input should be omitted.
- If using self-hosted runners or GitHub Enterprise Server, there are minimum requirements for `v4` to run. See "What's new" below for details.
### What's new
- Updated runtime to Node.js 16 - The action now requires a minimum version of v2.285.0 for the [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.285.0). - If using GitHub Enterprise Server, the action requires [GHES 3.4](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/release-notes) or later.
## Updating from `v2` to `v3`
### Breaking changes
- The `author` input now defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. This default is set via [action.yml](../action.yml) as `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>`, where `github.actor` is the GitHub user account associated with the run. For example, `peter-evans <peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com>`.
To continue to use the `v2` default, set the `author` input as follows. ```yaml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3 with: author: github-actions[bot] <41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> ```
- The `author` and `committer` inputs are no longer cross-used if only one is supplied. Additionally, when neither input is set, the `author` and `committer` are no longer determined from an existing identity set in git config. In both cases, the inputs will fall back to their default set in [action.yml](../action.yml).
- Deprecated inputs `project` and `project-column` have been removed in favour of an additional action step. See [Create a project card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#create-a-project-card) for details.
- Deprecated output `pr_number` has been removed in favour of `pull-request-number`.
- Input `request-to-parent` has been removed in favour of `push-to-fork`. This greatly simplifies pushing the pull request branch to a fork of the parent repository. See [Push pull request branches to a fork](concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details.
e.g. ```yaml - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Make changes to pull request here - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.MACHINE_USER_PAT }} push-to-fork: machine-user/fork-of-repository ```
### What's new
- The action has been converted to Typescript giving it a significant performance improvement.
- If you run this action in a container, or on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners), `python` and `pip` are no longer required dependencies. See [Running in a container or on self-hosted runners](concepts-guidelines.md#running-in-a-container-or-on-self-hosted-runners) for details.
- Inputs `labels`, `assignees`, `reviewers` and `team-reviewers` can now be newline separated, or comma separated. e.g. ```yml labels: | chore dependencies automated ```

- `v2` now expects repositories to be checked out with `actions/checkout@v2`
To use `actions/checkout@v1` the following step to checkout the branch is necessary. ```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Checkout branch run: git checkout "${GITHUB_REF:11}" ```
- The two branch naming strategies have been swapped. Fixed-branch naming strategy is now the default. i.e. `branch-suffix: none` is now the default and should be removed from configuration if set.
- `author-name`, `author-email`, `committer-name`, `committer-email` have been removed in favour of `author` and `committer`. They can both be set in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`
If neither `author` or `committer` are set the action will default to making commits as the GitHub Actions bot user.
### What's new
- Unpushed commits made during the workflow before the action runs will now be considered as changes to be raised in the pull request. See [Create your own commits](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#create-your-own-commits) for details.- New commits made to the pull request base will now be taken into account when pull requests are updated.- If an updated pull request no longer differs from its base it will automatically be closed and the pull request branch deleted.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments â€“ Credit Losses (â€œCECLâ€) accounting guidance, which resulted in a net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion and a decrease to retained earnings of $2.7 billion. Refer to Note 1 â€“ Basis of
Presentation on pages 85-86 of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 for further information.
(a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(b) Pre-provision profit, TBVPS and ROTCE are each non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity (â€œTCEâ€) is also a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to page 9 for a reconciliation of common stockholdersâ€™ equity to TCE. Refer to page 28 for a further discussion of
these measures.
(c) Refer to Reconciliation from Reported to Managed Basis on page 7 for a further discussion of managed basis.
(d) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.
(e) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the â€œFederal Reserveâ€) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31,
2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S.
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-92 of the Firmâ€™s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firmâ€™s capital metrics.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (â€œU.S. GAAPâ€). That presentation, which is referred to as â€œreportedâ€ basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firmâ€™s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firmâ€™s performance with other companiesâ€™ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firmâ€™s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
â€œmanagedâ€ basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholdersâ€™ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firmâ€™s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121â€“123 of the Firmâ€™s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80â€“82
of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

## Terminology
[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests) are proposed changes to a repository branch that can be reviewed by a repository's collaborators before being accepted or rejected. 
A pull request references two branches:
- The `base` of a pull request is the branch you intend to change once the proposed changes are merged.- The `branch` of a pull request represents what you intend the `base` to look like when merged. It is the `base` branch *plus* changes that have been made to it.
## Events and checkout
This action expects repositories to be checked out with the official GitHub Actions [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.For each [event type](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) there is a default `GITHUB_SHA` that will be checked out.
The default can be overridden by specifying a `ref` on checkout.
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: develop```
## How the action works
Unless the `base` input is supplied, the action expects the target repository to be checked out on the pull request `base`&mdash;the branch you intend to modify with the proposed changes.
Workflow steps:
1. Checkout the `base` branch2. Make changes3. Execute `create-pull-request` action
The following git diagram shows how the action creates and updates a pull request branch.
![Create Pull Request GitGraph](assets/cpr-gitgraph.png)
## Guidelines
### Providing a consistent base
For the action to work correctly it should be executed in a workflow that checks out a *consistent* base branch. This will be the base of the pull request unless overridden with the `base` input.
This means your workflow should be consistently checking out the branch that you intend to modify once the PR is merged.
In the following example, the [`push`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) and [`create`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#create) events both trigger the same workflow. This will cause the checkout action to checkout inconsistent branches and commits. Do *not* do this. It will cause multiple pull requests to be created for each additional `base` the action is executed against.
```ymlon: push: create:jobs: example: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3```
There may be use cases where it makes sense to execute the workflow on a branch that is not the base of the pull request. In these cases, the base branch can be specified with the `base` action input. The action will attempt to rebase changes made during the workflow on to the actual base.
### Events which checkout a commit
The [default checkout](#events-and-checkout) for the majority of events will leave the repository checked out on a branch.However, some events such as `release` and `pull_request` will leave the repository in a "detached HEAD" state.This is because they checkout a commit, not a branch.In these cases, you *must supply* the `base` input so the action can rebase changes made during the workflow for the pull request.
Workflows triggered by [`pull_request`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) events will by default check out a merge commit. Set the `base` input as follows to base the new pull request on the current pull request's branch.
```yml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: base: ${{ github.head_ref }}```
Workflows triggered by [`release`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release) events will by default check out a tag. For most use cases, you will need to set the `base` input to the branch name of the tagged commit.
```yml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: base: main```
### Restrictions on repository forks
GitHub Actions have imposed restrictions on workflow runs triggered by public repository forks.Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) from forks to run without restriction.
The restrictions apply to the `pull_request` event triggered by a fork opening a pull request in the upstream repository.
- Events from forks cannot access secrets, except for the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. > With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository. [GitHub Actions: Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow)
- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only access when an event is triggered by a forked repository.
[GitHub Actions: Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token)
These restrictions mean that during a `pull_request` event triggered by a forked repository, actions have no write access to GitHub resources and will fail on any attempt.
A job condition can be added to prevent workflows from executing when triggered by a repository fork.
```ymlon: pull_requestjobs: example: runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Check if the event is not triggered by a fork if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository```
For further reading regarding the security of pull requests, see this GitHub blog post titled [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
### Triggering further workflow runs
Pull requests created by the action using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger other workflows. If you have `on: pull_request` or `on: push` workflows acting as checks on pull requests, they will not run.
> When you use the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs. For example, if a workflow run pushes code using the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when `push` events occur.[GitHub Actions: Triggering a workflow from a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow)
#### Workarounds to trigger further workflow runs
There are a number of workarounds with different pros and cons.
- Use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` and allow the action to create pull requests that have no checks enabled. Manually close pull requests and immediately reopen them. This will enable `on: pull_request` workflows to run and be added as checks. To prevent merging of pull requests without checks erroneously, use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests).
- Use a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) created on an account that has write access to the repository that pull requests are being created in. This is the standard workaround and [recommended by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token). However, the PAT cannot be scoped to a specific repository so the token becomes a very sensitive secret. If this is a concern, the PAT can instead be created for a dedicated [machine account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements) that has collaborator access to the repository. Also note that because the account that owns the PAT will be the creator of pull requests, that user account will be unable to perform actions such as request changes or approve the pull request.
- Use [SSH (deploy keys)](#push-using-ssh-deploy-keys) to push the pull request branch. This is arguably more secure than using a PAT because deploy keys can be set per repository. However, this method will only trigger `on: push` workflows.
- Use a [machine account that creates pull requests from its own fork](#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork). This is the most secure because the PAT created only grants access to the machine account's fork, not the main repository. This method will trigger `on: pull_request` workflows to run. Workflows triggered `on: push` will not run because the push event is in the fork.
- Use a [GitHub App to generate a token](#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens) that can be used with this action. GitHub App generated tokens are more secure than using a PAT because GitHub App access permissions can be set with finer granularity and are scoped to only repositories where the App is installed. This method will trigger both `on: push` and `on: pull_request` workflows.
### Security
From a security perspective it's good practice to fork third-party actions, review the code, and use your fork of the action in workflows.By using third-party actions directly the risk exists that it could be modified to do something malicious, such as capturing secrets.
Alternatively, use the action directly and reference the commit hash for the version you want to target.```yml - uses: thirdparty/foo-action@172ec762f2ac8e050062398456fccd30444f8f30```
This action uses [ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the Node.js code and dependencies into a single JavaScript file under the [dist](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/tree/main/dist) directory.
## Advanced usage
### Creating pull requests in a remote repository
Checking out a branch from a different repository from where the workflow is executing will make *that repository* the target for the created pull request. In this case, a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required.
```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} repository: owner/repo # Make changes to pull request here - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}```
### Push using SSH (deploy keys)
[Deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) can be set per repository and so are arguably more secure than using a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).Allowing the action to push with a configured deploy key will trigger `on: push` workflows. This makes it an alternative to using a PAT to trigger checks for pull requests.Note that you cannot use deploy keys alone to [create a pull request in a remote repository](#creating-pull-requests-in-a-remote-repository) because then using a PAT would become a requirement. This method only makes sense if creating a pull request in the repository where the workflow is running.
How to use SSH (deploy keys) with create-pull-request action:
1. [Create a new SSH key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) for your repository. Do not set a passphrase.2. Copy the contents of the public key (.pub file) to a new repository [deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) and check the box to "Allow write access."3. Add a secret to the repository containing the entire contents of the private key.4. As shown in the example below, configure `actions/checkout` to use the deploy key you have created.
```yml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ssh-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }} # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
### Push pull request branches to a fork
Instead of pushing pull request branches to the repository you want to update, you can push them to a fork of that repository.This allows you to employ the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) by using a dedicated user acting as a [machine account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-account-requirements).This user only has `read` access to the main repository.It will use their own fork to push code and create the pull request.Note that if you choose to use this method (not give the machine account `write` access to the repository) the following inputs cannot be used: `labels`, `assignees`, `reviewers`, `team-reviewers` and `milestone`.
1. Create a new GitHub user and login.2. Fork the repository that you will be creating pull requests in.3. Create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).4. Logout and log back into your main user account.5. Add a secret to your repository containing the above PAT.6. As shown in the following example workflow, set the `push-to-fork` input to the full repository name of the fork.
```yaml - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.MACHINE_USER_PAT }} push-to-fork: machine-user/fork-of-repository```
### Authenticating with GitHub App generated tokens
A GitHub App can be created for the sole purpose of generating tokens for use with GitHub actions.These tokens can be used in place of `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).GitHub App generated tokens are more secure than using a PAT because GitHub App access permissions can be set with finer granularity and are scoped to only repositories where the App is installed.
1. Create a minimal [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app), setting the following fields:
- Set `GitHub App name`. - Set `Homepage URL` to anything you like, such as your GitHub profile page. - Uncheck `Active` under `Webhook`. You do not need to enter a `Webhook URL`. - Under `Repository permissions: Contents` select `Access: Read & write`. - Under `Repository permissions: Pull requests` select `Access: Read & write`. - Under `Organization permissions: Members` select `Access: Read-only`. - **NOTE**: Only needed if you would like add teams as reviewers to PRs.
2. Create a Private key from the App settings page and store it securely.
3. Install the App on any repository where workflows will run requiring tokens.
4. Set secrets on your repository containing the GitHub App ID, and the private key you created in step 2. e.g. `APP_ID`, `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
5. The following example workflow shows how to use [tibdex/github-app-token](https://github.com/tibdex/github-app-token) to generate a token for use with this action.
```yaml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v1 id: generate-token with: app_id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }} private_key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }} # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}```
### GPG commit signature verification
The action can use GPG to sign commits with a GPG key that you generate yourself.
1. Follow GitHub's guide to [generate a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key).
2. [Add the public key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account) to the user account associated with the [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) that you will use with the action.
3. Copy the private key to your clipboard, replacing `email@example.com` with the email address of your GPG key. ``` # macOS gpg --armor --export-secret-key email@example.com | pbcopy ```
4. Paste the private key into a repository secret where the workflow will run. e.g. `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
5. Create another repository secret for the key's passphrase, if applicable. e.g. `GPG_PASSPHRASE`
6. The following example workflow shows how to use [crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg) to import your GPG key and allow the action to sign commits.
Note that the `committer` email address *MUST* match the email address used to create your GPG key.
```yaml steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@v3 with: gpg-private-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }} passphrase: ${{ secrets.GPG_PASSPHRASE }} git-user-signingkey: true git-commit-gpgsign: true # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} committer: example <email@example.com>```
### Running in a container or on self-hosted runners
This action can be run inside a container, or on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners), by installing the necessary dependencies.
This action requires `git` to be installed and on the `PATH`. Note that `actions/checkout` requires Git 2.18 or higher to be installed, otherwise it will just download the source of the repository instead of cloning it.
The following examples of running in a container show the dependencies being installed during the workflow, but they could also be pre-installed in a custom image.
**Alpine container example:**```ymljobs: createPullRequestAlpine: runs-on: ubuntu-latest container: image: alpine steps: - name: Install dependencies run: apk --no-cache add git - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```
**Ubuntu container example:**```ymljobs: createPullRequestAlpine: runs-on: ubuntu-latest container: image: ubuntu steps: - name: Install dependencies run: | apt-get update apt-get install -y software-properties-common add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa apt-get install -y git - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Make changes to pull request here - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4```

## Use case: Create a pull request to update X on push
This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on pushed changes. Care should be taken when using this pattern in repositories with a high frequency of commits.
### Update project authors
Raises a pull request to update a file called `AUTHORS` with the git user names and email addresses of contributors.
```ymlname: Update AUTHORSon: push: branches: - mainjobs: updateAuthors: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Update AUTHORS run: | git log --format='%aN <%aE>%n%cN <%cE>' | sort -u > AUTHORS - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update authors title: Update AUTHORS body: Credit new contributors by updating AUTHORS branch: update-authors```### Keep a branch up-to-date with anotherThis is a use case where a branch should be kept up to date with another by opening a pull request to update it. The pull request should then be updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.In this example scenario, a branch called `production` should be updated via pull request to keep it in sync with `main`. Merging the pull request is effectively promoting those changes to production.```ymlname: Create production promotion pull requeston: push: branches: - mainjobs: productionPromotion: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: production - name: Reset promotion branch run: | git fetch origin main:main git reset --hard main - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: branch: production-promotion```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X on releaseThis pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on the tagged commit of a release. Note that because `release` is one of the [events which checkout a commit](concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit) it is necessary to supply the `base` input to the action.### Update changelogRaises a pull request to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file based on the tagged commit of the release.Note that [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog/) requires some configuration files to exist in the repository before this workflow will work.This workflow assumes the tagged release was made on a default branch called `main`.```ymlname: Update Changelogon: release: types: [published]jobs: updateChangelog: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 - name: Update Changelog run: | curl -o git-chglog -L https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog/releases/download/0.9.1/git-chglog_linux_amd64 chmod u+x git-chglog ./git-chglog -o CHANGELOG.md rm git-chglog - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update changelog title: Update Changelog body: Update changelog to reflect release changes branch: update-changelog base: main```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X periodicallyThis pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source. The workflow executes on a schedule and raises a pull request when there are changes.### Update NPM dependenciesThis workflow will create a pull request for npm dependencies.It works best in combination with a build workflow triggered on `push` and `pull_request`.A [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) can be used in order for the creation of the pull request to trigger further workflows. See the [documentation here](concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs) for further details.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: -

Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```The above workflow works best in combination with a build workflow triggered on `push` and `pull_request`.```ymlname: CIon: push: branches: [main] pull_request: branches: [main]jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: 16.x - run: npm ci - run: npm run test - run: npm run build```### Update Gradle dependenciesThe following workflow will create a pull request for Gradle dependencies.It requires first configuring your project to use Gradle lockfiles.See [here](https://github.com/peter-evans/gradle-auto-dependency-updates) for how to configure your project and use the following workflow.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 1 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: actions/setup-java@v2 with: distribution: 'temurin' java-version: 1.8 - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew run: chmod +x gradlew -

Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```### Update Cargo dependenciesThe following workflow will create a pull request for Cargo dependencies.It optionally uses [`cargo-edit`](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit) to update `Cargo.toml` and keep it in sync with `Cargo.lock`.```ymlname: Update Dependencieson: schedule: - cron: '0 1 * * 1'jobs: update-dep: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Update dependencies run: | cargo install cargo-edit cargo update cargo upgrade --to-lockfile - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} commit-message: Update dependencies title: Update dependencies body: | - Dependency updates Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1] [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request branch: update-dependencies```### Update SwaggerUI for GitHub PagesWhen using [GitHub Pages to host Swagger documentation](https://github.com/peter-evans/swagger-github-pages), this workflow updates the repository with the latest distribution of [SwaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).You must create a file called `swagger-ui.version` at the root of your repository before running.```ymlname: Update Swagger UIon: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * *'jobs: updateSwagger: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Get Latest Swagger UI Release id: swagger-ui run: | release_tag=$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest | jq -r ".tag_name") echo "release_tag=$release_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT current_tag=$(<swagger-ui.version) echo "current_tag=$current_tag" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT -

It assumes the default branch of the upstream repository is called `main`.The [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) should have `repo` scope. Additionally, if the upstream makes changes to the `.github/workflows` directory, the action will be unable to push the changes to a branch and throw the error "_(refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/xxx.yml` without `workflows` permission)_". To allow these changes to be pushed to the fork, add the `workflow` scope to the PAT. Of course, allowing this comes with the risk that the workflow changes from the upstream could run and do something unexpected. Disabling GitHub Actions in the fork is highly recommended to prevent this.When you merge the pull request make sure to choose the [`Rebase and merge`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) option. This will make the fork's commits match the commits on the upstream.```ymlname: Update forkon: schedule: - cron: '0 0 * * 0'jobs: updateFork: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: repository: fork-owner/repo - name: Reset the default branch with upstream changes run: | git remote add upstream https://github.com/owner/repo.git git fetch upstream main:upstream-main git reset --hard upstream-main - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: token: ${{ secrets.PAT }} branch: upstream-changes```### Spider and download a websiteThis workflow spiders a website and downloads the content. Any changes to the website will be raised in a pull request.```ymlname: Download Websiteon: schedule: - cron: '0 10 * * *'jobs: format: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Download website run: | wget \ --recursive \ --level=2 \ --wait=1 \ --no-clobber \ --page-requisites \ --html-extension \ --convert-links \ --domains quotes.toscrape.com \ http://quotes.toscrape.com/ - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: update local website copy title: Automated Updates to Local Website Copy body: This is an auto-generated PR with website updates. branch: website-updates```## Use case: Create a pull request to update X by calling the GitHub APIYou can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) when you want to trigger a workflow for any activity that happens outside of GitHub.This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source.You can modify any of the examples in the previous section to work in this fashion.Set the workflow to execute `on: repository_dispatch`.```ymlon: repository_dispatch: types: [create-pull-request]```### Call the GitHub API from an external serviceAn `on: repository_dispatch` workflow can be triggered by a call to the GitHub API as follows.- `[username]` is a GitHub username- `[token]` is a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)- `[repository]` is the name of the repository the workflow resides in.```curl -XPOST -u "[username]:[token]" \ -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repository]/dispatches \ --data '{"event_type": "create-pull-request"}'```### Call the GitHub API from another GitHub Actions workflowAn `on: repository_dispatch` workflow can be triggered from another workflow with [repository-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/repository-dispatch) action.```yml- name: Repository Dispatch uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v2 with: token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }} repository: username/my-repo event-type: create-pull-request client-payload: '{"ref": "${{ github.ref }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'```## Use case: Create a pull request to modify/fix pull requests**Note**: While the following approach does work, my strong recommendation would be to use a slash command style "ChatOps" solution for operations on pull requests. See [slash-command-dispatch](https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch) for such a solution.This is a pattern that lends itself to automated code linting and fixing. A pull request can be created to fix or modify something during an `on: pull_request` workflow. The pull request containing the fix will be raised with the original pull request as the base. This can be then be merged to update the original pull request and pass any required tests.Note that due to [token restrictions on public repository forks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token), workflows for this use case do not work for pull requests raised from forks.Private repositories can be configured to [enable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks) from forks to run without restriction. ### autopep8The following is an example workflow for a use case where [autopep8 action](https://github.com/peter-evans/autopep8) runs as both a check on pull requests and raises a further pull request to apply code fixes.How it works:1. When a pull request is raised the workflow executes as a check2. If autopep8 makes any fixes a pull request will be raised for those fixes to be merged into the current pull request branch. The workflow then deliberately causes the check to fail.3. When the pull request containing the fixes is merged the workflow runs again. This time autopep8 makes no changes and the check passes.4. The original pull request can now be merged.```ymlname: autopep8on: pull_requestjobs: autopep8: # Check if the PR is not raised by this workflow and is not from a fork if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'autopep8-patches') == false && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: ref: ${{ github.head_ref }} - name: autopep8 id: autopep8 uses: peter-evans/autopep8@v1 with: args: --exit-code --recursive --in-place --aggressive --aggressive . - name: Set autopep8 branch name id: vars run: | branch-name="autopep8-patches/${{ github.head_ref }}" echo "branch-name=$branch-name" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2 uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: commit-message: autopep8 action fixes title: Fixes by autopep8 action body: This is an auto-generated PR with fixes by autopep8. labels: autopep8, automated pr branch: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.branch-name }} - name: Fail if autopep8 made changes if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2 run: exit 1```## Misc workflow tips### Filtering push eventsFor workflows using `on: push` you may want to ignore push events for tags and only execute for branches. Specifying `branches` causes only events on branches to trigger the workflow. The `'**'` wildcard will match any branch name.```ymlon: push: branches: - '**' ```If you have a workflow that contains jobs to handle push events on branches as well as tags, you can make sure that the job where you use `create-pull-request` action only executes when `github.ref` is a branch by using an `if` condition as follows.```ymlon: pushjobs: createPullRequest: if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/') runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 ... someOtherJob: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 ...```### Dynamic configuration using variablesThe following examples show how configuration for the action can be dynamically defined in a previous workflow step.Note that the step where output variables are defined must have an id.```yml - name: Set output variables id: vars run: | pr_title="[Test] Add report file $(date +%d-%m-%Y)" pr_body="This PR was auto-generated on $(date +%d-%m-%Y) \ by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)." echo "pr_title=$pr_title" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "pr_body=$pr_body" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: title: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_title }} body: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_body }}```### Setting the pull request body from a fileThis example shows how file content can be read into a variable and passed to the action.```yml - id: get-pr-body run: | body=$(cat pr-body.txt) delimiter="$(openssl rand -hex 8)" echo "body<<$delimiter" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "$body" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT echo "$delimiter" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: body: ${{ steps.get-pr-body.outputs.body }}```### Using a markdown templateIn this example, a markdown template file is added to the repository at `.github/pull-request-template.md` with the following content.```This is a test pull request templateRender template variables such as {{ .foo }} and {{ .bar }}.```The template is rendered using the [render-template](https://github.com/chuhlomin/render-template) action and the result is used to create the pull request.```yml - name: Render template id: template uses: chuhlomin/render-template@v1.4 with: template: .github/pull-request-template.md vars: | foo: this bar: that - name: Create Pull Request uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4 with: body: ${{ steps.template.outputs.result }}```### Debugging GitHub Actions#### Runner Diagnostic Logging[Runner diagnostic logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-runner-diagnostic-logging) provides additional log files that contain information about how a runner is executing an action.To enable runner diagnostic logging, set the secret `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to `true` in the repository that contains the workflow.#### Step Debug Logging[Step debug logging](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-step-debug-logging) increases the verbosity of a job's logs during and after a job's execution.To enable step debug logging set the secret `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true` in the repository that contains the workflow.#### Output Various Contexts```yml steps: - name: Dump GitHub context env: GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }} run: echo "$GITHUB_CONTEXT" - name: Dump job context env: JOB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(job) }} run: echo "$JOB_CONTEXT" - name: Dump steps context env: STEPS_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(steps) }} run: echo "$STEPS_CONTEXT" - name: Dump runner context env: RUNNER_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(runner) }} run: echo "$RUNNER_CONTEXT" - name: Dump strategy context env: STRATEGY_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(strategy) }} run: echo "$STRATEGY_CONTEXT" - name: Dump matrix context env: MATRIX_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(matrix) }} run: echo "$MATRIX_CONTEXT"```

@@ -0,0 +1,87 @@## Updating from `v3` to `v4`
### Breaking changes
- The `add-paths` input no longer accepts `-A` as a valid value. When committing all new and modified files the `add-paths` input should be omitted.
- If using self-hosted runners or GitHub Enterprise Server, there are minimum requirements for `v4` to run. See "What's new" below for details.
### What's new
- Updated runtime to Node.js 16 - The action now requires a minimum version of v2.285.0 for the [Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.285.0). - If using GitHub Enterprise Server, the action requires [GHES 3.4](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/release-notes) or later.
## Updating from `v2` to `v3`
### Breaking changes
- The `author` input now defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. This default is set via [action.yml](../action.yml) as `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>`, where `github.actor` is the GitHub user account associated with the run. For example, `peter-evans <peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com>`.
To continue to use the `v2` default, set the `author` input as follows. ```yaml - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3 with: author: github-actions[bot] <41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> ```
- The `author` and `committer` inputs are no longer cross-used if only one is supplied. Additionally, when neither input is set, the `author` and `committer` are no longer determined from an existing identity set in git config. In both cases, the inputs will fall back to their default set in [action.yml](../action.yml).
- Deprecated inputs `project` and `project-column` have been removed in favour of an additional action step. See [Create a project card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#create-a-project-card) for details.
- Deprecated output `pr_number` has been removed in favour of `pull-request-number`.
- Input `request-to-parent` has been removed in favour of `push-to-fork`. This greatly simplifies pushing the pull request branch to a fork of the parent repository. See [Push pull request branches to a fork](concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details.
e.g. ```yaml - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Make changes to pull request here - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.MACHINE_USER_PAT }} push-to-fork: machine-user/fork-of-repository ```
### What's new
- The action has been converted to Typescript giving it a significant performance improvement.
- If you run this action in a container, or on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners), `python` and `pip` are no longer required dependencies. See [Running in a container or on self-hosted runners](concepts-guidelines.md#running-in-a-container-or-on-self-hosted-runners) for details.
- Inputs `labels`, `assignees`, `reviewers` and `team-reviewers` can now be newline separated, or comma separated. e.g. ```yml labels: | chore dependencies automated ```
## Updating from `v1` to `v2`
### Breaking changes
- `v2` now expects repositories to be checked out with `actions/checkout@v2`
To use `actions/checkout@v1` the following step to checkout the branch is necessary. ```yml - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - name: Checkout branch run: git checkout "${GITHUB_REF:11}" ```
- The two branch naming strategies have been swapped. Fixed-branch naming strategy is now the default. i.e. `branch-suffix: none` is now the default and should be removed from configuration if set.
- `author-name`, `author-email`, `committer-name`, `committer-email` have been removed in favour of `author` and `committer`. They can both be set in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`
If neither `author` or `committer` are set the action will default to making commits as the GitHub Actions bot user.
### What's new
- Unpushed commits made during the workflow before the action runs will now be considered as changes to be raised in the pull request. See [Create your own commits](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#create-your-own-commits) for details.- New commits made to the pull request base will now be taken into account when pull requests are updated.- If an updated pull request no longer differs from its base it will automatically be closed and the pull request branch deleted.

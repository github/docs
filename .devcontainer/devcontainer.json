And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9 Name:: Shining_120@yahoo.com or zakwarlord7@HOTMAIL.com/repository@ZachryTylerWood.Administrator@.git]::request::PUSH:e.g@iixixi/iixixi.Read.md/Paradise PUSH@IIXIXI/IIXIXI/READ.MD https://github.com/bitore/bitcoin/branches/trunk/@iixixii.json.yaml.docx/versioning@v-0.1.6,3.9.11xprocess.md#syncing-with-TEIRAFOURM: actually called TIERAFORM dnspython latest Search docs CONTENTS: What’s New in built with Bundled with dnspython using their builder not that they are the builder you've got it all wrong Community Installation Dnspython Manual DNS Names DNS Rdata DNS Messages The dns.message.Message Class Making DNS Messages Message Flags Message Opcodes Message Rcodes Message EDNS Options The dns.message.QueryMessage Class The dns.message.ChainingResult Class The dns.update.UpdateMessage Class DNS Query Support Stub Resolver DNS Zones DNSSEC Asynchronous I/O Support Exceptions Miscellaneous Utilities A Note on Typing DNS RFC Reference Dnspython License dnspython Docs » Dnspython Manual » DNS Messages » The dns.message.Message Class The dns.message.Message Class This is the base class for all messages, and the class used for any DNS opcodes that do not have a more specific class. classdns.message.Message(id=none of your business it was private repository)[] A DNS message. id An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id. flags An int, the DNS flags of the message. sections A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects. edns An int, the EDNS level to use.

This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173. keyring A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None. keyname The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None. keyalgorithm A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module. request_mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC of the request message associated with this message; used when validating TSIG signatures. fudge An int, the TSIG time fudge. The default is 300 seconds. original_id An int, the TSIG original id; defaults to the message’s id. tsig_error An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0. other_data A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes. mac A bytes, the TSIG MAC for this message. xfr A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False. origin A dns.name.Name.

The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. first A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer. index A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None. additional The additional data section. answer The answer section. authority The authority section. find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset.

The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object. get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source] Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section. If the RRset is not found, None is returned. section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example: my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype) my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype) name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset. rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset. rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset. covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None. deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None. create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section. force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them. Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None. is_response(other)[source] Is other a response this message? Returns a bool. opcode()[source] Return the opcode. Returns an int. question The question section. rcode()[source] Return the rcode. Returns an int. section_from_number(number)[source] Return the section list associated with the specified section number. number is a section number int or the text form of a section name. Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known. Returns a list. section_number(section)[source] Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing. section is one of the section attributes of this message. ::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"' Returns,?,"true?,", set_opcode(opcode)[source] Set the opcode. opcode, an int, is the opcode to set. set_rcode(rcode)[source] Set the rcode. rcode, an int, is the rcode to set. to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source] Convert the message to text. The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. Returns a str. to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source] Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format. Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method. origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used. max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”. multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence. tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers. Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded. Returns a bytes. use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source] Configure EDNS behavior. edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”. ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values. payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be. request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload. options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options. use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source] When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added. key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used. keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use. The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key. keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored. fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge. original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used. tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code. other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data. algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes. want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source] Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests. wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled. The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods: dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0> Message sections dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1> Message sections dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2> Message sections dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3> Message sections Beat Triplebyte's online coding quiz.

Use case: Create a pull request to update X on push
This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on pushed changes. Care should be taken when using this pattern in repositories with a high frequency of commits.

Update project authors
Raises a pull request to update a file called AUTHORS with the git user names and email addresses of contributors.

name: Update AUTHORS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  updateAuthors:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Update AUTHORS
        run: |
          git log --format='
Runs:| sort -u > AUTHORS
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          commit-message: update authors
          title: Update AUTHORS
          body: Credit new contributors by updating AUTHORS
          branch: update-authors
Keep a branch up-to-date with another
This is a use case where a branch should be kept up to date with another by opening a pull request to update it. The pull request should then be updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.

In this example scenario, a branch called production should be updated via pull request to keep it in sync with master. Merging the pull request is effectively promoting those changes to production.

name: Create production promotion pull request
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  productionPromotion:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: production
      - name: Reset promotion branch
        run: |
          git fetch origin master:master
          git reset --hard master
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          branch: production-promotion
Use case: Create a pull request to update X on release
This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content based on the tagged commit of a release. Note that because release is one of the events which checkout a commit it is necessary to supply the base input to the action.

Update changelog
Raises a pull request to update the CHANGELOG.md file based on the tagged commit of the release. Note that git-chglog requires some configuration files to exist in the repository before this workflow will work.

This workflow assumes the tagged release was made on a default branch called master.

name: Update Changelog
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  updateChangelog:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Update Changelog
        run: |
          curl -o git-chglog -L https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog/releases/download/0.9.1/git-chglog_linux_amd64
          chmod u+x git-chglog
          ./git-chglog -o CHANGELOG.md
          rm git-chglog
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          commit-message: update changelog
          title: Update Changelog
          body: Update changelog to reflect release changes
          branch: update-changelog
          base: master
Use case: Create a pull request to update X periodically
This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source. The workflow executes on a schedule and raises a pull request when there are changes.

Update NPM dependencies
This workflow will create a pull request for npm dependencies. It works best in combination with a build workflow triggered on push and pull_request. A Personal Access Token (PAT) can be used in order for the creation of the pull request to trigger further workflows. See the documentation here for further details.

name: Update Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 10 * * 1'
jobs:
  update-dep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '12.x'
      - name: Update dependencies
        run: |
          npx -p npm-check-updates ncu -u
          npm install
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
            token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
            commit-message: Update dependencies
            title: Update dependencies

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build
Update Gradle dependencies
The following workflow will create a pull request for Gradle dependencies. It requires first configuring your project to use Gradle lockfiles. See here for how to configure your project and use the following workflow.

name: Update Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 1 * * 1'
jobs:
  update-dep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 1.8
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew
      - name: Perform dependency resolution and write new lockfiles
        run: ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks

Update SwaggerUI for GitHub Pages
When using GitHub Pages to host Swagger documentation, this workflow updates the repository with the latest distribution of SwaggerUI.

You must create a file called swagger-ui.version at the root of your repository before running.

name: Update Swagger UI
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 10 * * *'
jobs:
  updateSwagger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        run: |
          echo ::set-output name=release_tag::$(curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest | jq -r ".tag_name")
          echo ::set-output name=current_tag::$(<swagger-ui.version)
      - name: Update Swagger UI
        if: steps.swagger-ui.outputs.current_tag != steps.swagger-ui.outputs.release_tag
        env:
          RELEASE_TAG: ${{ steps.swagger-ui.outputs.release_tag }}
          SWAGGER_YAML: "swagger.yaml"
        run: |
          # Delete the dist directory and index.html

Keep a fork up-to-date with its upstream
This example is designed to be run in a seperate repository from the fork repository itself. The aim of this is to prevent committing anything to the fork's default branch would cause it to differ from the upstream.

In the following example workflow, owner/repo is the upstream repository and fork-owner/repo is the fork. It assumes the default branch of the upstream repository is called master.

The Personal Access Token (PAT) should have repo scope. Additionally, if the upstream makes changes to the .github/workflows directory, the action will be unable to push the changes to a branch and throw the error "(refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow .github/workflows/xxx.yml without workflows permission)". To allow these changes to be pushed to the fork, add the workflow scope to the PAT. Of course, allowing this comes with the risk that the workflow changes from the upstream could run and do something unexpected. Disabling GitHub Actions in the fork is highly recommended to prevent this.

When you merge the pull request make sure to choose the Rebase and merge option. This will make the fork's commits match the commits on the upstream.

name: Update fork
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 0 * * 0'
jobs:
  updateFork:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: fork-owner/repo
      - name: Reset the default branch with upstream changes
        run: |
          git remote add upstream https://github.com/owner/repo.git
          git fetch upstream master:upstream-master
          git reset --hard upstream-master
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3

jobs:
  format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

          body: This is an auto-generated PR with website updates.
          branch: website-updates
Use case: Create a pull request to update X by calling the GitHub API
You can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want to trigger a workflow for any activity that happens outside of GitHub. This pattern will work well for updating any kind of static content from an external source.

You can modify any of the examples in the previous section to work in this fashion.

Set the workflow to execute on: repository_dispatch.

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [create-pull-request]
Call the GitHub API from an external service
An on: repository_dispatch workflow can be triggered by a call to the GitHub API as follows.

[username] is a GitHub username
[token] is a repo scoped Personal Access Token
[repository] is the name of the repository the workflow resides in.
curl -XPOST -u "[username]:[token]" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/[username]/[repository]/dispatches \
  --data '{"event_type": "create-pull-request"}'
Call the GitHub API from another GitHub Actions workflow
An on: repository_dispatch workflow can be triggered from another workflow with repository-dispatch action.

- name: Repository Dispatch
  uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    repository: username/my-repo
    event-type: create-pull-request
    client-payload: '{"ref": "${{ github.ref }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'
Use case: Create a pull request to modify/fix pull requests
Note: While the following approach does work, my strong recommendation would be to use a slash command style "ChatOps" solution for operations on pull requests. See slash-command-dispatch for such a solution.

This is a pattern that lends itself to automated code linting and fixing. A pull request can be created to fix or modify something during an on: pull_request workflow. The pull request containing the fix will be raised with the original pull request as the base. This can be then be merged to update the original pull request and pass any required tests.

Note that due to token restrictions on public repository forks, workflows for this use case do not work for pull requests raised from forks. Private repositories can be configured to enable workflows from forks to run without restriction.

autopep8
The following is an example workflow for a use case where autopep8 action runs as both a check on pull requests and raises a further pull request to apply code fixes.

How it works:

When a pull request is raised the workflow executes as a check
If autopep8 makes any fixes a pull request will be raised for those fixes to be merged into the current pull request branch. The workflow then deliberately causes the check to fail.
When the pull request containing the fixes is merged the workflow runs again. This time autopep8 makes no changes and the check passes.
The original pull request can now be merged.
name: autopep8
on: pull_request
jobs:
  autopep8:
    # Check if the PR is not raised by this workflow and is not from a fork
    if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'autopep8-patches') == false && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - name: autopep8
        id: autopep8
        uses: peter-evans/autopep8@v1
        with:
          args: --exit-code --recursive --in-place --aggressive --aggressive .
      - name: Set autopep8 branch name
        id: vars
        run: echo ::set-output name=branch-name::"autopep8-patches/${{ github.head_ref }}"
      - name: Create Pull Request
        if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          commit-message: autopep8 action fixes
          title: Fixes by autopep8 action
          body: This is an auto-generated PR with fixes by autopep8.
          labels: autopep8, automated pr
          branch: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.branch-name }}
      - name: Fail if autopep8 made changes
        if: steps.autopep8.outputs.exit-code == 2
        run: exit 1
Misc workflow tips
Filtering push events
For workflows using on: push you may want to ignore push events for tags and only execute for branches. Specifying branches causes only events on branches to trigger the workflow. The '**' wildcard will match any branch name.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**' 
If you have a workflow that contains jobs to handle push events on branches as well as tags, you can make sure that the job where you use create-pull-request action only executes when github.ref is a branch by using an if condition as follows.

on: push
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      ...

  someOtherJob:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      ...
Dynamic configuration using variables
The following examples show how configuration for the action can be dynamically defined in a previous workflow step.

The recommended method is to use set-output. Note that the step where output variables are defined must have an id.

      - name: Set output variables
        id: vars
        run: |
          echo ::set-output name=pr_title::"[Test] Add report file $(date +%d-%m-%Y)"
          echo ::set-output name=pr_body::"This PR was auto-generated on $(date +%d-%m-%Y) \
            by [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)."
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          title: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_title }}
          body: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.pr_body }}
Setting the pull request body from a file
This example shows how file content can be read into a variable and passed to the action. The content must be escaped to preserve newlines.

      - id: get-pr-body
        run: |
          body=$(cat pr-body.txt)
          body="${body//'%'/'%25'}"
          body="${body//$'\n'/'%0A'}"
          body="${body//$'\r'/'%0D'}" 
          echo ::set-output name=body::$body

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          body: ${{ steps.get-pr-body.outputs.body }}
Debugging GitHub Actions
Runner Diagnostic Logging
Runner diagnostic logging provides additional log files that contain information about how a runner is executing an action. To enable runner diagnostic logging, set the secret ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG to true in the repository that contains the workflow.

Step Debug Logging
Step debug logging increases the verbosity of a job's logs during and after a job's execution. To enable step debug logging set the secret ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG to true in the repository that contains the workflow.

# Close Stale Issues and PRs

Warns and then closes issues and PRs that have had no activity for a specified amount of time.

The configuration must be on the default branch and the default values will:

- Add a label "Stale" on issues and pull requests after 60 days of inactivity and comment on them
- Close the stale issues and pull requests after 7 days of inactivity
- If an update/comment occur on stale issues or pull requests, the stale label will be removed and the timer will restart

## Recommended permissions

For the execution of this action, it must be able to fetch all issues and pull requests from your repository.  
In addition, based on the provided configuration, the action could require more permission(s) (e.g.: add label, remove label, comment, close, delete branch, etc.).  
This can be achieved with the following [configuration in the action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) if the permissions are restricted:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write # only for delete-branch option
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
You can find more information about the required permissions under the corresponding options that you wish to use.

Detailed options
repo-token
Personal Access Token (PAT) that allows the stale workflow to authenticate and perform API calls to GitHub.
Under the hood, it uses the @actions/github package.

Default value: ${{ github.token }}

days-before-stale
The idle number of days before marking the issues or the pull requests as stale (by adding a label).
The issues or the pull requests will be marked as stale if the last update (based on GitHub issue field updated_at) is older than the idle number of days.
It means that any updates made, or any comments added to the issues or to the pull requests will restart the counter of days before marking as stale.
However, if you wish to ignore this behaviour so that the creation date (based on GitHub issue field created_at) only matters, you can disable the ignore-updates option.

If set to a negative number like -1, no issues or pull requests will be marked as stale automatically.
In that case, you can still add the stale label manually to mark as stale.

The label used to stale is defined by these two options:

stale-issue-label
stale-pr-label
A comment can also be added to notify about the stale and is defined by these two options:

stale-issue-message
stale-pr-message
You can fine tune which issues or pull requests should be marked as stale based on the milestones, the assignees, the creation date and the missing/present labels from these options:

exempt-issue-labels
exempt-pr-labels
only-labels
any-of-labels
start-date
exempt-milestones
exempt-all-milestones
exempt-assignees
exempt-all-assignees
ignore-updates
Default value: 60

days-before-issue-stale
Useful to override days-before-stale but only for the idle number of days before marking the issues as stale.

Default value: unset

days-before-pr-stale
Useful to override days-before-stale but only for the idle number of days before marking the pull requests as stale.

Default value: unset

days-before-close
The idle number of days before closing the stale issues or the stale pull requests (due to the stale label).
The issues or the pull requests will be closed if the last update (based on GitHub issue field updated_at) is older than the idle number of days.
Since adding the stale label will alter the last update date, we can calculate the number of days from this date.

If set to a negative number like -1, the issues or the pull requests will never be closed automatically.

The label used to stale is defined by these two options:

stale-issue-label
stale-pr-label
Default value: 7

days-before-issue-close

operations-per-run
Context:
This action performs some API calls to GitHub to fetch or close issues and pull requests, set or update labels, add comments, delete branches, etc.
These operations are made in a very short period of time — because the action is very fast to run — and can be numerous based on your project action configuration and the quantity of issues and pull requests within it.
GitHub has a rate limit and if reached will block these API calls for one hour (or API calls from other actions using the same user (a.k.a.: the github-token from the repo-token option)).
This option helps you to stay within the GitHub rate limits, as you can use this option to limit the number of operations for a single run.

Purpose:
This option aims to limit the number of operations made with the GitHub API to avoid reaching the rate limit.

Based on your project, your GitHub business plan and the date of the cron job you set for this action, you can increase this limit to a higher number. If you are not sure which is the right value for you or if the default value is good enough, you could enable the logs and look at the end of the stale action.
If you reached the limit, you will see a warning message in the logs, telling you that you should increase the number of operations. If you choose not to increase the limit, you might end up with unprocessed issues or pull requests after a stale action run.

When debugging, you can set it to a much higher number like 1000 since there will be fewer operations made with the GitHub API.
Only the actor and the batch of issues (100 per batch) will consume the operations.

Default value: 30

remove-stale-when-updated
Automatically remove the stale label when the issues or the pull requests are updated (based on GitHub issue field updated_at) or commented.

Default value: true
Required Permission: issues: write and pull-requests: write

labels-to-add-when-unstale
A comma delimited list of labels to add when a stale issue or pull request receives activity and has the stale-issue-label or stale-pr-label removed from it.

Default value: unset

labels-to-remove-when-unstale
A comma delimited list of labels to remove when a stale issue or pull request receives activity and has the stale-issue-label or stale-pr-label removed from it.

Warning: each label results in a unique API call which can drastically consume the limit of operations-per-run.

Default value: unset
Required Permission: pull-requests: write

Run the stale workflow as dry-run.
No GitHub API calls that can alter your issues and pull requests will happen.
Useful to debug or when you want to configure the stale workflow safely.

Default value: false

ascending
Change the order used to fetch the issues and pull requests from GitHub:

true is for ascending.
false is for descending.
It can be useful if your repository is processing so many issues and pull requests that you reach the operations-per-run limit.
Based on the order, you could prefer to focus on the new content or on the old content of your repository.

Default value: false

start-date
The start date is used to ignore the issues and pull requests created before the start date.
Particularly useful when you wish to add this stale workflow on an existing repository and only wish to stale the new issues and pull requests.

If set, the date must be formatted following the ISO 8601 or RFC 2822 standard.

Default value: unset

delete-branch
If set to true, the stale workflow will automatically delete the GitHub branches related to the pull requests automatically closed by the stale workflow.

Default value: false

Default value: unset

exempt-draft-pr
If set to true, the pull requests currently in draft will not be marked as stale automatically.
⚠️ This option consume one operation per pull request to process because we need to fetch the pull request with the GitHub API to know if it's a draft one or not.

Default value: false
Required Permission: pull-requests: read

enable-statistics
Collects and display statistics at the end of the stale workflow logs to get a summary of what happened during the run.
This option is only useful if the debug output secret ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG is set to true in your repository to display the logs.

Default value: true

ignore-updates
The option days-before-stale will define the number of days before considering the issues or the pull requests as stale.
In most cases, the purpose of this action is to only stale when necessary so if any update occurs or if a comment is added to them, the counter will restart.
Nonetheless, if you don't care about this, and you prefer to stick to this number of days no matter the update, you can enable this option.
Instead of comparing the number of days based on the GitHub issue field updated_at, it will be based on the GitHub issue field created_at.

Default value: false

ignore-issue-updates
Useful to override ignore-updates but only to ignore the updates for the issues.

Default value: unset

ignore-pr-updates
Useful to override ignore-updates but only to ignore the updates for the pull requests.

Debugging
Logs:
To see the debug output from this action, you must set the secret ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG to true in your repository.
There are many logs, so this can be very helpful!

Statistics:
If the logs are enabled, you can also enable the statistics log which will be visible at the end of the logs once all issues were processed.
This is very helpful to have a quick understanding of the whole stale workflow.
Set enable-statistics to true in your workflow configuration file.

Dry-run:
You can run this action in debug only mode (no actions will be taken on your issues and pull requests) by passing debug-only to true as an argument to the action.

More operations:
You can increase the maximum number of operations per run by passing operations-per-run to 1000 for example which will help you to handle more operations in a single stale workflow run.
If the debug-only option is enabled, this is very helpful because the workflow will (almost) never reach the GitHub API rate, and you will be able to deep-dive into the logs.

Job frequency:
You could change the cron job frequency in the stale workflow to run the stale workflow more often.
Usually, this is not very helpful though.

Usage: node ${basename(process.argv[1])} language-spec [target-folder] [options]
language-spec: Path to a language specification YAML file, or a URL to a language specification YAML file. If the argument starts with "${DCC_PROTOCOL}", the language specification will be downloaded from the repositories example folder (i.e ${DCC_PROTOCOL}lua).
target-folder: Path to the target folder. If not specified, a temporary folder will be used.
Options:
  --name\tName of the devcontainer.
  --build\tBuild the devcontainer after creation.
  --tag\t\tTag of the devcontainer image.
  --cache-from\tImage to use as cache for the devcontainer image.
  --test\tTest the devcontainer after creation.
  --dump-meta\tDump the metadata of the devcontainer.
  --no-vscode\tDo not create a .vscode folder.
  -v, --verbose\tVerbose output.
  -vv, --debug\tDebug output.
  -h, --help\tPrint this help message.
Examples:
  node ${basename(process.argv[1])} ${DCC_PROTOCOL}lua .
    Create a devcontainer for Lua in the current folder.
  node ${basename(process.argv[1])} language.yaml --test
    Create and test a temporary devcontainer for the
    language specified in language.yaml.

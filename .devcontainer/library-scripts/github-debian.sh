+TYPE WHEN TO USE OBJECTS HOW TO USE CONSIDERATIONS
+Test mode Use this mode as you build your app. Payments are not processed by card networks or payment providers. API calls return simulated account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription. Use test credit cards and accounts. Don’t use actual payment authorizations, charges, or captures. Identity doesn’t perform any verification checks. Connect account objects don’t return sensitive fields.
+Live mode Use this mode when you’re ready to launch your app. Card networks or payment providers process payments. API calls return actual account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription objects. Use valid credit cards and accounts. Use actual payment authorizations, charges, and captures for credit cards and accounts. Disputes have a more nuanced flow and a simpler testing process. Some Sources payment methods have a more nuanced flow and require more steps.
+Use only your test API keys for testing and development. This ensures that you don’t accidentally modify your live customers or charges.
+
+If you don’t have an administrator or developer role, you may not have access to view your API keys in the Dashboard. Ask your Stripe account’s owner to add you to their team as a developer.

+An API secret key for live mode is only visible the first time you access it. After that, the Dashboard no longer shows the secret key. Use these steps to reveal a secret key and leave a note that describes where it lives in your own systems.
+Open the API keys page.
+Click Reveal live key.
+In Notes, enter where your key lives in your own systems.
+Keys created prior to the introduction of this feature are not automatically hidden when they are revealed, but can be hidden manually.
+
+Revoke (“roll”) an API secret key
+If you’re in live mode and you lose your API secret key or API restricted key, you can’t recover it from the Dashboard. Similarly, if your secret key is compromised, you need to revoke (“roll”) the key to block any API requests that might use that key. Use these steps to revoke your API secret key and generate a new key.

+Open the API keys page.
+Click the three dots (…) next to your secret key, click Roll key.

+
+Keeping your keys safe
+Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account, such as creating charges or performing refunds. Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using. Control access to your key using a password manager or secrets management service.
+
+Limiting access with restricted API keys
+A restricted API key allows only the minimum level of access that you specify. Restricted keys cannot interact with many parts of Stripe’s API and are intended to reduce risk when using or building microservices. They should not be used as an alternative to your account’s API keys during development of your Stripe integration.
+
+Use restricted API keys if you’re working with microservices that interact with the Stripe API on your behalf. You can create restricted API keys that limit access to, and permissions to specific account data. For example, you can create a restricted key that grants read-only access to dispute data, then use it with a dispute monitoring service.

+Test and live modes overview
+All Stripe API requests occur in either test or live mode. API objects in one mode (for example, product objects) aren’t accessible to the other.
+
+TYPE WHEN TO USE OBJECTS HOW TO USE CONSIDERATIONS
+Test mode Use this mode as you build your app. Payments are not processed by card networks or payment providers. API calls return simulated account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription. Use test credit cards and accounts. Don’t use actual payment authorizations, charges, or captures. Identity doesn’t perform any verification checks. Connect account objects don’t return sensitive fields.
+Live mode Use this mode when you’re ready to launch your app. Card networks or payment providers process payments. API calls return actual account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription objects. Use valid credit cards and accounts. Use actual payment authorizations, charges, and captures for credit cards and accounts. Disputes have a more nuanced flow and a simpler testing process. Some Sources payment methods have a more nuanced flow and require more steps.
+API keys
+All accounts have a total of four keys: a publishable and secret key pair for test mode and live mode. Stripe APIs use your secret key to authenticate requests on your server. By default, your account’s secret keys can be used to perform any API request without restriction. You can find your keys on the API Keys page in the Developers Dashboard.
+
+Stripe automatically populates code examples in our documentation with your test API keys while you’re logged in—only you can see these values. For your convenience, your test API keys for Zachry T Wood III are:

Can be publicly-accessible in your web or mobile app’s client-side code (such as checkout.js) to tokenize payment information such as with Stripe Elements. By default, Stripe Checkout tokenizes payment information.

Must be secret and stored securely in your web or mobile app’s server-side code (such as in an environment variable or credential management system) to call Stripe APIs.
+Use only your test API keys for testing and development. This ensures that you don’t accidentally modify your live customers or charges.

Test and live modes overview
All Stripe API requests occur in either test or live mode. API objects in one mode (for example, product objects) aren’t accessible to the other.


++TYPE WHEN TO USE OBJECTS HOW TO USE CONSIDERATIONS
++Test mode Use this mode as you build your app. Payments are not processed by card networks or payment providers. API calls return simulated account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription. Use test credit cards and accounts. Don’t use actual payment authorizations, charges, or captures. Identity doesn’t perform any verification checks. Connect account objects don’t return sensitive fields.
++Live mode Use this mode when you’re ready to launch your app. Card networks or payment providers process payments. API calls return actual account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription objects. Use valid credit cards and accounts. Use actual payment authorizations, charges, and captures for credit cards and accounts. Disputes have a more nuanced flow and a simpler testing process. Some Sources payment methods have a more nuanced flow and require more steps.
++Use only your test API keys for testing and development. This ensures that you don’t accidentally modify your live customers or charges.
++
++If you don’t have an administrator or developer role, you may not have access to view your API keys in the Dashboard. Ask your Stripe account’s owner to add you to their team as a developer.
++
++Reveal an API secret key for live mode (one time)
++An API secret key for live mode is only visible the first time you access it. After that, the Dashboard no longer shows the secret key. Use these steps to reveal a secret key and leave a note that describes where it lives in your own systems.
++
++Open the API keys page.
++Click Reveal live key.
++In Notes, enter where your key lives in your own systems.
++Keys created prior to the introduction of this feature are not automatically hidden when they are revealed, but can be hidden manually.
++
++Revoke (“roll”) an API secret key
++If you’re in live mode and you lose your API secret key or API restricted key, you can’t recover it from the Dashboard. Similarly, if your secret key is compromised, you need to revoke (“roll”) the key to block any API requests that might use that key. Use these steps to revoke your API secret key and generate a new key.

++Keeping your keys safe
++Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account, such as creating charges or performing refunds. Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using. Control access to your key using a password manager or secrets management service.
++
++Limiting access with restricted API keys
++A restricted API key allows only the minimum level of access that you specify. Restricted keys cannot interact with many parts of Stripe’s API and are intended to reduce risk when using or building microservices. They should not be used as an alternative to your account’s API keys during development of your Stripe integration.
++
++Use restricted API keys if you’re working with microservices that interact with the Stripe API on your behalf. You can create restricted API keys that limit access to, and permissions to specific account data. For example, you can create a restricted key that grants read-only access to dispute data, then use it with a dispute monitoring service.

++Test and live modes overview
++All Stripe API requests occur in either test or live mode. API objects in one mode (for example, product objects) aren’t accessible to the other.
++
++TYPE WHEN TO USE OBJECTS HOW TO USE CONSIDERATIONS
++Test mode Use this mode as you build your app. Payments are not processed by card networks or payment providers. API calls return simulated account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription. Use test credit cards and accounts. Don’t use actual payment authorizations, charges, or captures. Identity doesn’t perform any verification checks. Connect account objects don’t return sensitive fields.
++Live mode Use this mode when you’re ready to launch your app. Card networks or payment providers process payments. API calls return actual account, payment, customer, charge, refund, transfer, balance, and subscription objects. Use valid credit cards and accounts. Use actual payment authorizations, charges, and captures for credit cards and accounts. Disputes have a more nuanced flow and a simpler testing process. Some Sources payment methods have a more nuanced flow and require more steps.
++API keys
++All accounts have a total of four keys: a publishable and secret key pair for test mode and live mode. Stripe APIs use your secret key to authenticate requests on your server. By default, your account’s secret keys can be used to perform any API request without restriction. You can find your keys on the API Keys page in the Developers Dashboard.
++
++Stripe automatically populates code examples in our documentation with your test API keys while you’re logged in—only you can see these values. For your convenience, your test API keys for Zachry T Wood III are:
++
++TYPE VALUE WHEN TO USE
++Publishable pk_test_51HGcX6KxqqA7JcPHGKhUYWGwyDAtLfKwLokfN7r5147gR7OvVobKLgKav910ex6i2R3GIY0dJme1X40MiXEr7KE300Jr0Vp8q5 On the client-side. Can be publicly-accessible in your web or mobile app’s client-side code (such as checkout.js) to tokenize payment information such as with Stripe Elements. By default, Stripe Checkout tokenizes payment information.
++Secret sk_test_51HGcX6KxqqA7JcPH8qFPAp6Nsobyz7QbHlGhO1bTYTJ5eiYPuWKT5UCjOcjNxO7acotmtcXBFFbotbesOWDYL1Bb00MoZWPU2r On the server-side. Must be secret and stored securely in your web or mobile app’s server-side code (such as in an environment variable or credential management system) to call Stripe APIs.
++Use only your test API keys for testing and development. This ensures that you don’t accidentally modify your live customers or charges.
++
++If you don’t have an administrator or developer role, you may not have access to view your API keys in the Dashboard. Ask your Stripe account’s owner to add you to their team as a developer.
++
++Reveal an API secret key for live mode (one time)
++An API secret key for live mode is only visible the first time you access it. After that, the Dashboard no longer shows the secret key. Use these steps to reveal a secret key and leave a note that describes where it lives in your own systems.
++
++Open the API keys page.
++Click Reveal live key.
++In Notes, enter where your key lives in your own systems.
++Keys created prior to the introduction of this feature are not automatically hidden when they are revealed, but can be hidden manually.
++
++Revoke (“roll”) an API secret key
++If you’re in live mode and you lose your API secret key or API restricted key, you can’t recover it from the Dashboard. Similarly, if your secret key is compromised, you need to revoke (“roll”) the key to block any API requests that might use that key. Use these steps to revoke your API secret key and generate a new key.
++
++Open the API keys page.
++Click the three dots (…) next to your secret key, click Roll key.
++In Expiration, choose when to expire the existing key:
++now
++in 1 hour
++in 24 hours
++in 3 days
++in 7 days
++Click Roll API key.

+This repository contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for docs.github.com.
+GitHub's Docs team works on pre-production content in a private repo that regularly syncs with this public repo.

+## Contributing.md
+See the contributing guide for detailed instructions on how to get started with our project.
+We accept different types of contributions, including some that don't require you to write a single line of code.
+On the GitHub Docs site, you can click the make a contribution button at the bottom of the page to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.
+
+For more complex contributions, you can open an issue using the most appropriate issue template to describe the changes you'd like to see.
+If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our existing issues for something to work on. When ready, check out Getting Started with Contributing for detailed instructions.
+# Join us in discussions
+We use GitHub Discussions to talk about all sorts of topics related to documentation and this site. For example: if you'd like help troubleshooting a PR, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in the discussions.

About self-hosted runners
A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% ifversion ghae or ghec %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "Understanding {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}{% ifversion fpt %}."{% elsif ghec or ghes or ghae %}" and "About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for enterprises."{% endif %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-description %} {% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-locations %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-architecture %} {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management hierarchy:

Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository.
Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization.
Enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.
Your runner machine connects to {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} self-hosted runner application. {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

Requirements for self-hosted runner machines
You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these requirements:

You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the machine. For more information, see "Supported architectures and operating systems for self-hosted runners."
The machine can communicate with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}."
The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires minimal resources.
If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be installed.
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghec or ghae-issue-4462 %}

Autoscaling your self-hosted runners
You can automatically increase or decrease the number of self-hosted runners in your environment in response to the webhook events you receive. For more information, see "Autoscaling with self-hosted runners."

{% endif %}

Usage limits
There are some limits on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.

{% data reusables.actions.usage-workflow-run-time %}

Job queue time - Each job for self-hosted runners can be queued for a maximum of 24 hours. If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.
{% data reusables.actions.usage-api-requests %}
Job matrix - {% data reusables.actions.usage-matrix-limits %}
{% data reusables.actions.usage-workflow-queue-limits %}

{% ifversion ghes %}

Supported actions on self-hosted runners
Some extra configuration might be required to use actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, or to use the actions/setup-LANGUAGE actions with self-hosted runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see "Managing access to actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}" and contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} site administrator.

{% endif %}


Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}
The self-hosted runner polls {% data variables.product.product_name %} to retrieve application updates and to check if any jobs are queued for processing. The self-hosted runner uses a HTTPS long poll that opens a connection to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for 50 seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept and run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-ports-protocols %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-communications-for-ghae %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Since the self-hosted runner opens a connection to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you do not need to allow {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to make inbound connections to your self-hosted runner.

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} hosts listed below. Some hosts are required for essential runner operations, while other hosts are only required for certain functionality.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

Needed for essential operations:

github.com
api.github.com
Needed for downloading actions:

codeload.github.com
Needed for runner version updates:

objects.githubusercontent.com
objects-origin.githubusercontent.com
github-releases.githubusercontent.com
github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com
Needed for uploading/downloading caches and workflow artifacts:

*.blob.core.windows.net
Needed for retrieving OIDC tokens:

*.actions.githubusercontent.com
In addition, your workflow may require access to other network resources. For example, if your workflow installs packages or publishes containers to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Packages, then the runner will also require access to those network endpoints.

If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account, you must add your self-hosted runner's IP address to the allow list. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)" or "[Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise){% ifversion fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}

{% else %}

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with {% data variables.product.product_location %}.{% ifversion ghes %} Self-hosted runners connect directly to {% data variables.product.product_location %} and do not require any external internet access in order to function. As a result, you can use network routing to direct communication between the self-hosted runner and {% data variables.product.product_location %}. For example, you can assign a private IP address to your self-hosted runner and configure routing to send traffic to {% data variables.product.product_location %}, with no need for traffic to traverse a public network.{% endif %}

{% endif %}

You can also use self-hosted runners with a proxy server. For more information, see "Using a proxy server with self-hosted runners."

For more information about troubleshooting common network connectivity issues, see "Monitoring and troubleshooting self-hosted runners."

{% ifversion ghes %}

Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}
Self-hosted runners do not need to connect to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} unless you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}.

If you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, then the self-hosted runner will connect directly to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to download actions. You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} URLs listed below.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

{% 'var'' %}

Self-hosted runner security
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

This is not an issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners because each {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution.

{% endif %}

Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if your machine persists its environment between jobs. Some of the risks include:

Malicious programs running on the machine.
Escaping the machine's runner sandbox.
Exposing access to the machine's network environment.
Persisting unwanted or dangerous data on the machine.
For more information about security hardening for self-hosted runners, see "Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}."

About self-hosted runner groups
{% ifversion fpt %}
{% note %}

Note: All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Only enterprise accounts and organizations owned by enterprise accounts can create and manage additional self-hosted runner groups.

{% endnote %}

Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners. Organization admins can configure access policies that control which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.

If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you can create additional runner groups; enterprise admins can configure access policies that control which organizations in an enterprise have access to the runner group; and organization admins can assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise runner group. For more information, see the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes or ghae %}
Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners at the organization and enterprise level. Enterprise owners can configure access policies that control which organizations {% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}and workflows {% endif %}in an enterprise have access to the runner group. Organization owners can configure access policies that control which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} in an organization have access to the runner group.

When an enterprise owner grants an organization access to a runner group, organization owners can see the runner group listed in the organization's self-hosted runner settings. The organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner group.

When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the default group. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move runners from the default group to another group. For more information, see "Moving a self-hosted runner to a group."

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an organization
All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Organizations within an enterprise account can create additional self-hosted groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see "Self-hosted runner groups."

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} have access to the runner group.

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an enterprise
Enterprises can add their self-hosted runners to groups for access management. Enterprises can create groups of self-hosted runners that are accessible to specific organizations in the enterprise account{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or to specific workflows{% endif %}. Organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner groups. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see the enterprise endpoints in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} REST API.

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can assign the runner to a specific group during the registration process, or you can later move the runner from the default group to a custom group.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which organizations have access to the runner group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-add-to-enterprise-first-steps %}

To choose a policy for organization access, select the Organization access drop-down, and click a policy. You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of organizations, or all organizations in the enterprise.{% ifversion ghes %} By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this.{% endif %}

Changing the access policy of a self-hosted runner group
For runner groups in an enterprise, you can change what organizations in the enterprise can access a runner group{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or restrict what workflows a runner group can run{% endif %}. For runner groups in an organization, you can change what repositories in the organization can access a runner group{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or restrict what workflows a runner group can run{% endif %}.

{% endif %}

{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}

Changing what workflows can access a runner group
You can configure a self-hosted runner group to run either selected workflows or all workflows. For example, you might use this setting to protect secrets that are stored on self-hosted runners or to standardize deployment workflows by restricting a runner group to run only a specific reusable workflow. This setting cannot be overridden if you are configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runner-groups-selection %}

Under Workflow access, select the dropdown menu and click Selected workflows.

Click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="the gear icon" %}.

Enter a comma separated list of the workflows that can access the runner group. Use the full path, including the repository name and owner. Pin the workflow to a branch, tag, or full SHA. For example: octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@v2, octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@d6dc6c96df4f32fa27b039f2084f576ed2c5c2a5, monalisa/octo-test/.github/workflows/test.yml@main.

Only jobs directly defined within the selected workflows will have access to the runner group.

Organization-owned runner groups cannot access workflows from a different organization in the enterprise; instead, you must create an enterprise-owned runner group.

Click Save.

Automatically adding a self-hosted runner to a group
You can use the configuration script to automatically add a new self-hosted runner to a group. For example, this command registers a new self-hosted runner and uses the --runnergroup parameter to add it to a group named rg-runnergroup.

./config.sh --url $org_or_enterprise_url --token $token --runnergroup rg-runnergroup
The command will fail if the runner group doesn't exist:

Could not find any self-hosted runner group named "rg-runnergroup".
Moving a self-hosted runner to a group
If you don't specify a runner group during the registration process, your new self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group, and can then be moved to another group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-navigate-to-org-enterprise %}
{% ifversion ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-5091 %}

In the "Runners" list, click the runner that you want to configure.
Select the Runner group drop-down.
In "Move runner to group", choose a destination group for the runner.
{% elsif ghae or ghes < 3.4 %}
In the {% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae %}"Runner groups"{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}"Self-hosted runners"{% endif %} section of the settings page, locate the current group of the runner you want to move and expand the list of group members.
View runner group members
Select the checkbox next to the self-hosted runner, and then click Move to group to see the available destinations.
Runner group member move
To move the runner, click on the destination group.
Runner group member move
{% endif %}
Removing a self-hosted runner group
Self-hosted runners are automatically returned to the default group when their group is removed.

{% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}

In the list of groups, to the right of the group you want to delete, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}.

To remove the group, click Remove group.

Review the confirmation prompts, and click Remove this runner group.
{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}

In the "Self-hosted runners" section of the settings page, locate the group you want to delete, and click the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %} button.

About self-hosted runners
A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% ifversion ghae or ghec %}{% data variables.product.product_name %}{% else %}{% data variables.product.product_location %}{% endif %}. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, see "Understanding {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}{% ifversion fpt %}."{% elsif ghec or ghes or ghae %}" and "About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} for enterprises."{% endif %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-description %} {% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-locations %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-architecture %} {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

You can add self-hosted runners at various levels in the management hierarchy:

Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository.
Organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization.
Enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.
Your runner machine connects to {% data variables.product.product_name %} using the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} self-hosted runner application. {% data reusables.actions.runner-app-open-source %} When a new version is released, the runner application automatically updates itself when a job is assigned to the runner, or within a week of release if the runner hasn't been assigned any jobs.

Requirements for self-hosted runner machines
You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these requirements:

You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the machine. For more information, see "Supported architectures and operating systems for self-hosted runners."
The machine can communicate with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For more information, see "Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}."
The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires minimal resources.
If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be installed.
{% ifversion fpt or ghes > 3.2 or ghec or ghae-issue-4462 %}

Autoscaling your self-hosted runners
You can automatically increase or decrease the number of self-hosted runners in your environment in response to the webhook events you receive. For more information, see "Autoscaling with self-hosted runners."

{% endif %}

Usage limits
There are some limits on {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.

{% data reusables.actions.usage-workflow-run-time %}

Job queue time - Each job for self-hosted runners can be queued for a maximum of 24 hours. If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.

{% ifversion ghes %}

Supported actions on self-hosted runners
Some extra configuration might be required to use actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, or to use the actions/setup-LANGUAGE actions with self-hosted runners that do not have internet access. For more information, see "Managing access to actions from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}" and contact your {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} site administrator.

{% endif %}

Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.product_name %}
The self-hosted runner polls {% data variables.product.product_name %} to retrieve application updates and to check if any jobs are queued for processing. The self-hosted runner uses a HTTPS long poll that opens a connection to {% data variables.product.product_name %} for 50 seconds, and if no response is received, it then times out and creates a new long poll. The application must be running on the machine to accept and run {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-ports-protocols %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-communications-for-ghae %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

Since the self-hosted runner opens a connection to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, you do not need to allow {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} to make inbound connections to your self-hosted runner.

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} hosts listed below. Some hosts are required for essential runner operations, while other hosts are only required for certain functionality.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

Needed for essential operations:

github.com
api.github.com
Needed for downloading actions:

codeload.github.com
Needed for runner version updates:

objects.githubusercontent.com
objects-origin.githubusercontent.com
github-releases.githubusercontent.com
github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com
Needed for uploading/downloading caches and workflow artifacts:

*.blob.core.windows.net
Needed for retrieving OIDC tokens:

*.actions.githubusercontent.com
In addition, your workflow may require access to other network resources. For example, if your workflow installs packages or publishes containers to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Packages, then the runner will also require access to those network endpoints.

If you use an IP address allow list for your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} organization or enterprise account, you must add your self-hosted runner's IP address to the allow list. For more information, see "[Managing allowed IP addresses for your organization](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#using-github-actions-with-an-ip-allow-list)" or "[Enforcing policies for security settings in your enterprise](/{% ifversion fpt %}enterprise-cloud@latest/{% endif %}admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-security-settings-in-your-enterprise){% ifversion fpt %}" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.{% else %}."{% endif %}

{% else %}

You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with {% data variables.product.product_location %}.{% ifversion ghes %} Self-hosted runners connect directly to {% data variables.product.product_location %} and do not require any external internet access in order to function. As a result, you can use network routing to direct communication between the self-hosted runner and {% data variables.product.product_location %}. For example, you can assign a private IP address to your self-hosted runner and configure routing to send traffic to {% data variables.product.product_location %}, with no need for traffic to traverse a public network.{% endif %}

{% endif %}

You can also use self-hosted runners with a proxy server. For more information, see "Using a proxy server with self-hosted runners."

For more information about troubleshooting common network connectivity issues, see "Monitoring and troubleshooting self-hosted runners."

{% ifversion ghes %}

Communication between self-hosted runners and {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}
Self-hosted runners do not need to connect to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} unless you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}.

If you have enabled automatic access to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} actions using {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, then the self-hosted runner will connect directly to {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} to download actions. You must ensure that the machine has the appropriate network access to communicate with the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} URLs listed below.

{% note %}

Note: Some of the domains listed below are configured using CNAME records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all CNAME records. Note that the CNAME records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed below will remain constant.

{% endnote %}

{% 'var'' %}

Self-hosted runner security
{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-security %}

{% endif %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

This is not an issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runners because each {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution.

{% endif %}

Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if your machine persists its environment between jobs. Some of the risks include:

Malicious programs running on the machine.
Escaping the machine's runner sandbox.
Exposing access to the machine's network environment.
Persisting unwanted or dangerous data on the machine.
For more information about security hardening for self-hosted runners, see "Security hardening for {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}."

About self-hosted runner groups
{% ifversion fpt %}
{% note %}

Note: All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Only enterprise accounts and organizations owned by enterprise accounts can create and manage additional self-hosted runner groups.

{% endnote %}

Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners. Organization admins can configure access policies that control which repositories in an organization have access to the runner group.

If you use {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}, you can create additional runner groups; enterprise admins can configure access policies that control which organizations in an enterprise have access to the runner group; and organization admins can assign additional granular repository access policies to the enterprise runner group. For more information, see the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} documentation.
{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec or ghes or ghae %}
Self-hosted runner groups are used to control access to self-hosted runners at the organization and enterprise level. Enterprise owners can configure access policies that control which organizations {% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}and workflows {% endif %}in an enterprise have access to the runner group. Organization owners can configure access policies that control which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} in an organization have access to the runner group.

When an enterprise owner grants an organization access to a runner group, organization owners can see the runner group listed in the organization's self-hosted runner settings. The organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner group.

When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the default group. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move runners from the default group to another group. For more information, see "Moving a self-hosted runner to a group."

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an organization
All organizations have a single default self-hosted runner group. Organizations within an enterprise account can create additional self-hosted groups. Organization admins can allow individual repositories access to a runner group. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see "Self-hosted runner groups."

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can move a runner from the default group to any group you create.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} and workflows{% endif %} have access to the runner group.

Creating a self-hosted runner group for an enterprise
Enterprises can add their self-hosted runners to groups for access management. Enterprises can create groups of self-hosted runners that are accessible to specific organizations in the enterprise account{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or to specific workflows{% endif %}. Organization owners can then assign additional granular repository{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %} or workflow{% endif %} access policies to the enterprise runner groups. For information about how to create a self-hosted runner group with the REST API, see the enterprise endpoints in the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} REST API.

Self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group when created, and can only be members of one group at a time. You can assign the runner to a specific group during the registration process, or you can later move the runner from the default group to a custom group.

When creating a group, you must choose a policy that defines which organizations have access to the runner group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-add-to-enterprise-first-steps %}

To choose a policy for organization access, select the Organization access drop-down, and click a policy. You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of organizations, or all organizations in the enterprise.{% ifversion ghes %} By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this.{% endif %}

{% endif %}

{% if restrict-groups-to-workflows %}

Changing what workflows can access a runner group
You can configure a self-hosted runner group to run either selected workflows or all workflows. For example, you might use this setting to protect secrets that are stored on self-hosted runners or to standardize deployment workflows by restricting a runner group to run only a specific reusable workflow. This setting cannot be overridden if you are configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}
{% data reusables.actions.settings-sidebar-actions-runner-groups-selection %}

Under Workflow access, select the dropdown menu and click Selected workflows.

Click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="the gear icon" %}.

Enter a comma separated list of the workflows that can access the runner group. Use the full path, including the repository name and owner. Pin the workflow to a branch, tag, or full SHA. For example: octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/build.yml@v2, octo-org/octo-repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@d6dc6c96df4f32fa27b039f2084f576ed2c5c2a5, monalisa/octo-test/.github/workflows/test.yml@main.

Only jobs directly defined within the selected workflows will have access to the runner group.

Organization-owned runner groups cannot access workflows from a different organization in the enterprise; instead, you must create an enterprise-owned runner group.

Click Save.

Automatically adding a self-hosted runner to a group
You can use the configuration script to automatically add a new self-hosted runner to a group. For example, this command registers a new self-hosted runner and uses the --runnergroup parameter to add it to a group named rg-runnergroup.

./config.sh --url $org_or_enterprise_url --token $token --runnergroup rg-runnergroup
The command will fail if the runner group doesn't exist:

Could not find any self-hosted runner group named "rg-runnergroup".
Moving a self-hosted runner to a group
If you don't specify a runner group during the registration process, your new self-hosted runners are automatically assigned to the default group, and can then be moved to another group.

{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-navigate-to-org-enterprise %}
{% ifversion ghec or ghes > 3.3 or ghae-issue-5091 %}

In the "Runners" list, click the runner that you want to configure.
Select the Runner group drop-down.
In "Move runner to group", choose a destination group for the runner.
{% elsif ghae or ghes < 3.4 %}
In the {% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae %}"Runner groups"{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}"Self-hosted runners"{% endif %} section of the settings page, locate the current group of the runner you want to move and expand the list of group members.
View runner group members
Select the checkbox next to the self-hosted runner, and then click Move to group to see the available destinations.
Runner group member move
To move the runner, click on the destination group.
Runner group member move
{% endif %}
Removing a self-hosted runner group
Self-hosted runners are automatically returned to the default group when their group is removed.

{% ifversion ghes > 3.1 or ghae or ghec %}
{% data reusables.actions.self-hosted-runner-groups-navigate-to-repo-org-enterprise %}

In the list of groups, to the right of the group you want to delete, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %}.

To remove the group, click Remove group.

Review the confirmation prompts, and click Remove this runner group.
{% elsif ghes < 3.2 %}

In the "Self-hosted runners" section of the settings page, locate the group you want to delete, and click the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab icon" %} button.
View runner group settings

To remove the group, click Remove group.

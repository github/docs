Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the GitHub CLI!
We accept pull requests for bug fixes and features where we've discussed the approach in an issue and given the go-ahead for a community member to work on it. We'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.
Please do:

Check existing issues to verify that the [bug][bug issues] or [feature request][feature request issues] has not already been submitted.
Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
Open an issue to propose a significant change.
Open a pull request to fix a bug.
Open a pull request to fix documentation about a command.
Open a pull request for any issue labelled [help wanted][hw] or [good first issue][gfi].
Please avoid:
Opening pull requests for issues marked needs-design, needs-investigation, or blocked.
Adding installation instructions specifically for your OS/package manager.
Opening pull requests for any issue marked core. These issues require additional context from
the core CLI team at GitHub and any external pull requests will not be accepted.

# Styles

This website uses a Sass preprocessor, and gets most of its styles from GitHub's
[Primer](https://primer.style) design system.

All styles come from imports in our Next.js components (pages, components).

In general, we use Primer's [utility classes](https://primer.style/css/utilities) as much as we can, and avoid writing custom styles whenever possible.

See [https://primer.style/](https://primer.style/) for reference.

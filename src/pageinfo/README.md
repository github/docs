# Pageinfo endpoint

This subject folder contains the code for the `/api/pageinfo` endpoint.

## What it does

The `/api/pageinfo` endpoint powers the hover preview for internal links on <docs.github.com>.

## How it works

The `/api/pageinfo` endpoint returns information about a page by `pathname`. It is highly cached, in JSON format.

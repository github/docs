## About breaking changes

Breaking changes are any changes that might require action from our integrators. We divide these changes into two categories:

* **Breaking:** Changes that will break existing queries to the GraphQL API. For example, removing a field would be a breaking change.
* **Dangerous:** Changes that won't break existing queries but could affect the runtime behavior of clients. Adding an enum value is an example of a dangerous change.

We'll announce upcoming breaking changes at least three months before making changes to the GraphQL schema, to give integrators time to make the necessary adjustments.

  # The list of children in the fixtures has to be the same names
  # as we use in the real content. It can have fewer but can't include
  # anything that the real `/content/index.md` doesn't contain for this.
  # The reason is that the `npm run build` compiles a list of rewrites
  # so that URLs like `/en/get-started/anything` can be treated,
  # as if the URL had been `/en/free-pro-team@latest/get-started/anything`.

> [!NOTE] This article lists events that may appear in the audit log for an **enterprise**. For the events that can appear in a user account's security log or the audit log for an organization, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events) and [AUTOTITLE](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/audit-log-events-for-your-organization).

## What types of events are included?

* **Without Enterprise Managed Users**, the audit log only includes events related to the enterprise account and the organizations within it.
* **With Enterprise Managed Users**, the audit log also includes user events, which are not listed here. For that list, see [AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events).

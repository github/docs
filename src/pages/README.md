# Pages

This is the Next.js pages directory.

See <https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory>

There is almost no code in this directory, instead the actual pages live with their subject siblings. These files directly export from the page files in the relative subjects.

TODO migrate code out of `_error.tsx`, `_document.tsx`, and `404.tsx`.
